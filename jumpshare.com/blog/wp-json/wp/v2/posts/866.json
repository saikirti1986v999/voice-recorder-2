The other half is knowing how well your files are performing and gaining insights\u00a0into\u00a0your audience.\u00a0Today, we\u2019re excited to launch <b>Analytics<\/b> for Jumpshare Plus. Analytics help you analyze\u00a0how your files are performing and gives you a comprehensive overview of your audience detailing\u00a0who\u2019s viewed and downloaded your files. An actionable dashboard of top files, top referrers, total views and downloads always keeps you in the loop. Use Analytics to gain valuable insight into your audience\u00a0to grow your business. Know which countries your visitors come from, which web browsers and operating systems they use, and what screen resolutions the files are being viewed on.<\/p>\n<p>You will see a new tab on your left sidebar called Analytics. By default, it shows you data from the past 30 days, but\u00a0you customize the date range\u00a0from the selector on top right corner of the graph. You can filter data by\u00a0referrers and files, and the dashboard will automatically update to reflect the change. This is what the Analytics dashboard looks like:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/jumpshare.com\/plus\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-927\" src=\"https:\/\/blog-cdn.jumpshare.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/analytics-for-blog.png\" alt=\"analytics-for-blog\" width=\"600\" height=\"1409\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re looking to quickly view data for a recently shared folder or file, just right-click it and select \u201cView Stats\u201d to open a pop-up box where you can take a quick glance of how\u2019s it performing.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/jumpshare.com\/plus\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-928\" src=\"https:\/\/blog-cdn.jumpshare.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/View-stats-pop-up-for-blog.png\" alt=\"View-stats-pop-up-for-blog\" width=\"600\" height=\"360\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Since Analytics is a new feature, file stats from before will not be available however starting today, all visits to your files will be tracked. Over the next few days, your Analytics page will start populating with data, depending on how many visitors view your files.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019re happy to be the first file sharing service to bring Advanced Analytics to individuals and small businesses at a simple, affordable price with Jumpshare Plus (at just $9.99\/month). It\u2019s simple, fast and easy to use!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/jumpshare.com\/plus\">Upgrade to Jumpshare Plus<\/a><\/p>\n<p>P.S. Analytics is only available on the web app. The next update will bring Analytics to the desktop apps. The upcoming iPhone app will also have the Analytics tab built-in. We can&#8217;t wait to release them.
