Whether you are conducting a training and development session or onboarding new employees, video is your savior when it comes to clear communication. Fast, efficient, and direct, video content yields immense impact if delivered correctly.<\/p>\n<p>However, what good is content if not shared at its full potential? The quality of video content often gets reduced by compression when you share it through social media channels such as YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter, or messaging apps such as WhatsApp. Lucky for you, this common problem has many solutions so you can easily overcome the hurdle of sending videos without compromising on the quality.<\/p>\n<h2>Send Videos via Cloud Storage Services<\/h2>\n<p>A widely preferred method of sending videos and other media files is to use a cloud storage service. With cloud-based sharing platforms having become mainstream a while ago, we can finally bid adieu to the era of using hard drives and USBs to move files around. Now all you need to do is upload the video files to online storage and share it with your intended audience. Some commonly used cloud storage-sharing platforms include Google Drive, iCloud, OneDrive, and Dropbox.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2824 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/blog-cdn.jumpshare.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Google-Drive_video-sharing.png\" alt=\"Google Drive video sharing\" width=\"1300\" height=\"950\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blog-cdn.jumpshare.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Google-Drive_video-sharing.png 1300w, https:\/\/blog-cdn.jumpshare.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Google-Drive_video-sharing-300x219.png 300w, https:\/\/blog-cdn.jumpshare.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Google-Drive_video-sharing-1024x748.png 1024w, https:\/\/blog-cdn.jumpshare.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Google-Drive_video-sharing-768x561.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1300px) 100vw, 1300px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The process is roughly the same for each of these services &#8211; you upload a video to your account, select the uploaded file from your library, and copy a shareable link to it.<\/p>\n<p>Alternatives like Jumpshare offer additional features geared toward video sharing, such as video CTA (call-to-action) and timed comments.<!--more--><\/p>\n<h2>Send Videos via Email<\/h2>\n<p>A commonly used tool in every corporate workspace, emails are an old-school but reliable way to send videos from your computer or phone without compromising on the video quality. While this way might be convenient when dealing with smaller video files, there is usually a size limit imposed on the medium. This means that you&#8217;ll either have to keep your videos short or share via a link to a third-party service. For example, Gmail allows files over 25MB to be uploaded to and shared through Google Drive.<\/p>\n<p>As uncompressed videos tend to be relatively larger in size, you&#8217;ll most likely have to use email in conjunction with one of the other services mentioned here.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2821 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/blog-cdn.jumpshare.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Gmail-Video-Sharing_.png\" alt=\"Gmail Video Sharing\" width=\"1300\" height=\"964\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blog-cdn.jumpshare.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Gmail-Video-Sharing_.png 1300w, https:\/\/blog-cdn.jumpshare.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Gmail-Video-Sharing_-300x222.png 300w, https:\/\/blog-cdn.jumpshare.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Gmail-Video-Sharing_-1024x759.png 1024w, https:\/\/blog-cdn.jumpshare.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Gmail-Video-Sharing_-768x570.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1300px) 100vw, 1300px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Send Videos Through a File Transfer Website<\/h2>\n<p>In light of the rapidly increasing demand for sharing platforms, there are several platforms with the sole purpose of being dedicated file transfer websites, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/jumpshare.com\/wetransfer-alternative\">WeTransfer<\/a>. You can upload large files of any format and share them with people via a shareable link. With a medium such as this, the potential risk of your video landing in the wrong hands can&#8217;t be taken lightly, which is why some services may offer a password-protected service for an extra layer of security.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2819 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/blog-cdn.jumpshare.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/WeTransfer.png\" alt=\"WeTransfer\" width=\"1300\" height=\"731\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blog-cdn.jumpshare.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/WeTransfer.png 1300w, https:\/\/blog-cdn.jumpshare.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/WeTransfer-300x169.png 300w, https:\/\/blog-cdn.jumpshare.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/WeTransfer-1024x576.png 1024w, https:\/\/blog-cdn.jumpshare.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/WeTransfer-768x432.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1300px) 100vw, 1300px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Send Videos Using Jumpshare<\/h2>\n<p>With Jumpshare, you can send large, uncompressed video files quickly and securely via link or email.
