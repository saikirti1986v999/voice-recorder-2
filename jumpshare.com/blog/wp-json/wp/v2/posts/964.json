Where our goal at Jumpshare is to make file sharing as easy as possible for our users, receiving files from others is also something we want\u00a0to simplify. After many months of brainstorming and development, we\u2019re happy to introduce <strong>Jumpshare Inbox<\/strong>, a permanent solution to this very problem. Once set up, you\u2019re given a unique personalized link which you can share with anyone to receive files instantly in your Inbox. It\u2019s as easy as the name suggests.<\/p>\n<h4><b>How it works:<\/b><\/h4>\n<p>Visit the Settings page and you will find a new section called \u201cInbox&#8221;. Take your time to set it up by giving your Inbox a unique name, which will become the vanity URL.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-993\" src=\"https:\/\/blog-cdn.jumpshare.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/set-up-inbox1.png\" alt=\"set up inbox\" width=\"419\" height=\"225\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Once done, you will be given a unique personalized URL based on the name you choose for your Inbox.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-994\" src=\"https:\/\/blog-cdn.jumpshare.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/Inbox-name.png\" alt=\"Inbox name\" width=\"569\" height=\"205\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Now just share this link with anyone to instantly receive files in your Inbox. We\u2019ve made the Inbox link such that it\u2019s easy to memorize. The recipient has to write his\/her name and email, add files and just hit Send. It\u2019s that easy! The recipient also has the option to write a subject or a message, both of which are optional.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-998\" src=\"https:\/\/blog-cdn.jumpshare.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/Jumpshare-Inbox2.png\" alt=\"Jumpshare Inbox\" width=\"600\" height=\"311\" \/><\/p>\n<p>There is no limit to the number of files you can receive, nor is there any file size limit.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1000\" src=\"https:\/\/blog-cdn.jumpshare.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/Jumpshare-Inbox-Uploading1.png\" alt=\"Jumpshare Inbox Uploading\" width=\"600\" height=\"328\" \/><\/p>\n<p>All received files go in your Inbox. To access the files, go to the \u201cShared\u201d tab and you will find them\u00a0listed on the &#8220;Shared with me&#8221; page. You can view files, download them, or save them to your account for permanent safekeeping.<\/p>\n<p>Inbox is going to be a lifesaver for those whose work depends on receiving files from their customers on a daily basis. Let us know what you think about this feature. Jumpshare Inbox is available to all Plus users.
