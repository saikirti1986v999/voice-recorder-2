We\u2019re introducing both collections and nested folders which will have a significant impact on how you organize your files.<\/p>\n<h4>What Is A Collection?<\/h4>\n<p>A collection is a group of files and folders that you can share with anyone. Use collections to organize your work by clients, projects, events, etc. Inside each collection, you can upload an unlimited number of files, links, and folders.<\/p>\n<h4>Your Dashboard Looks Different Today<\/h4>\n<p>When you first login to your dashboard, you will see a default collection called &#8220;Previous Uploads&#8221;. This collection contains all files you uploaded prior to Jumpshare 3.0. When you upload files using the desktop apps, they will get added to \u201cDesktop Uploads\u201d which is another collection that is created automatically.<\/p>\n<p>We recommend that you create a few collections to organize your projects. Collections can be sorted by \u201cRecently Created\u201d or \u201cLast Modified\u201d. By default, all collections are sorted by \u201cRecently Created\u201d. To create a new collection, click the \u201cNew\u201d button on the sidebar.<\/p>\n<h4>Inside A Collection<\/h4>\n<p>You can upload an unlimited number of files, folders, and links to a collection. We now support folder hierarchy; if you upload a folder (containing sub-folders) we will keep the directory structure intact. You can sort items inside a collection by type, date, name, or size. The default sorting applied to files and folders inside a newly created collection is \u201ctype\u201d.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1401\" src=\"https:\/\/blog-cdn.jumpshare.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/inside-collection.png\" alt=\"inside collection\" width=\"595\" height=\"438\" \/><\/p>\n<h4>Sharing Collections<\/h4>\n<p>You can share your collections as easily as you can share the files and folders inside a collection. In the quest to make file management better, we wanted to ensure the &#8220;quick sharing&#8221; aspect was not lost.<\/p>\n<h4>Keeping Things In Order<\/h4>\n<p>Tagging still remains the best way to find files quickly by power users and with Jumpshare 3.0, we now allow users to tag both files and folders inside a collection (previously tagging was restricted to folders only). Because we\u2019re now supporting nested folders, we\u2019ve removed nested tags because they would have become redundant in the large scheme of things. All nested tags will be attached to their parent tags. We\u2019ve also removed the 3 tags per item limitation; now you can apply an unlimited number of tags to any item.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1416\" src=\"https:\/\/blog-cdn.jumpshare.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/tag-files-and-folders-together-jumpshare.png\" alt=\"tag files and folders together jumpshare\" width=\"600\" height=\"399\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Similarly, you can now merge both files and folders into a single folder so long as they are in the same collection or in the same folder. Previously merging was limited to folders only.<\/p>\n<h4>Keeping Things Safe &amp; Private<\/h4>\n<p>Starting today, a collection and all items inside it (folders, files, and links) will have it\u2019s own individual lock and self-destruct options. Previously, you could only lock a folder and if you applied a lock, it applied it to all individual files inside that folder which made it hard to share certain files (which you don\u2019t want locked). But now you can choose which folder and file to lock and then share it securely. A locked item will show a lock indicator, which means the recipient will have to enter a password to access it.<\/p>\n<p>Similarly, you can now set any individual item to self-destruct. If you choose to self-destruct a collection or a folder, then all items inside it will also self-destruct.<\/p>\n<h4>Faster Uploads<\/h4>\n<p>We\u2019ve optimized our multi-part uploading to speed up the process. When you upload a large file, we break it down into multiple parts to speed up the uploading, and when finished, we merge these parts back together. If merging parts of a 200MB file took 60 seconds before, it now takes only 1 second in Jumpshare 3.0. That\u2019s a whooping 6000% increase in speed.<\/p>\n<h4>A Slew Of Enhancements<\/h4>\n<p>We\u2019ve made a series of enhancements that make using Jumpshare a fantastic experience:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The thumbnails now show modified date instead of date of creation. The thumbs also show the actual dates for items older than \u201cYesterday\u201d. Which means instead of showing the relative age of a file as \u201c2 months ago\u201d, we now show \u201cMar 16\u201d.<\/li>\n<li>In our file viewer, you will now see a blue outline around the selected file thumbnail at the bottom panel. Hovering over these thumbs will show you the file name in a tooltip.<\/li>\n<li>When moving between pages, you will now see a progress bar above the header that indicates how much the page has loaded.<\/li>\n<li>Thumbnails now show the preview of the first file inside a collection or a folder. You can sort or rearrange your files to make a certain image show up first so it appears in the thumbnail.<\/li>\n<li>Deleting a collection requires you to check additional checkboxes to prevent accidental deletions.<\/li>\n<li>Newly uploaded videos will now play at 480p quality, up from 360p.<\/li>\n<li>A new navigation menu shows when you click the \u201c&lt;\u201d button from\u00a0a\u00a02nd level folder and onwards.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>And a ton of other enhancements made on both the front-end and back-end.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1419\" src=\"https:\/\/blog-cdn.jumpshare.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/navigation-back-jumpshare.png\" alt=\"navigation back jumpshare\" width=\"492\" height=\"220\" \/><\/p>\n<h4>Desktop Apps Get Smarter<\/h4>\n<p>All files (including screenshots) uploaded from the Jumpshare desktop apps now go in the \u201cDesktop Uploads\u201d collection. Single files are no longer added to a new folder every time you upload them, thus preventing clutter and keeping things more organized.<\/p>\n<p>On both the Mac and Windows apps, we show 5 recently modified items from all collections. So if you upload\/modify any file inside any collection on the web, it will show up in the desktop app, thus you can access and share it easily again from the comfort of your desktop without having to visit the website.<\/p>\n<h4>What&#8217;s Next?<\/h4>\n<p>The next step is to allow you to invite others to your collection for direct collaboration. We\u2019re also working on a list view to make browsing your files faster. Our brand new OS X app is in the final stages of development and will launch\u00a0soon, followed by an iPhone app which is also under development. We&#8217;re also working on an API to allow third party developers to build apps and integrate Jumpshare in their products.<\/p>\n<p>If you would like to test our upcoming features and apps before we make them public, you can join our beta testers list <a href=\"http:\/\/goo.gl\/forms\/wFFukWKqNy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h4>Start Sharing!<\/h4>\n<p>We recommend that you create a few collections to get started with Jumpshare 3.0. We&#8217;ve put a lot of effort into this release after hearing your feedback. We hope you like it. If you have any questions or feedback, shoot us an email at hello@jumpshare.com and we\u2019ll be happy to help.<\/p>\n<p>Happy sharing!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/jumpshare.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Visit your dashboard<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Today we\u2019re announcing Jumpshare 3.0; a version that fights the clutter on your dashboard and improves file management.
