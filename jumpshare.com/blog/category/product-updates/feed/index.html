<p>Today, we’re thrilled to release customizable screenshot backgrounds, scrolling screenshots, and automatic redaction of sensitive information from screenshots for <a href="https://jumpshare.com/downloading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Windows</a> (coming soon to Mac)!</p>
<h2>Make Your Screenshots Pop With Gorgeous Backgrounds</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3475 aligncenter" src="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Backgrounds_feat.jpg" alt="Screenshots Backgrounds" width="1847" height="1039" srcset="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Backgrounds_feat.jpg 1847w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Backgrounds_feat-350x197.jpg 350w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Backgrounds_feat-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Backgrounds_feat-768x432.jpg 768w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Backgrounds_feat-1536x864.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1847px) 100vw, 1847px" /></p>
<p>The latest version of our Windows app adds a new <strong>Background Options</strong> tool to the screenshot annotation window.</p>
<p>Now pick from an assortment of vibrant gradients and solid colors to serve as your screenshot’s background. With a single click, turn even the most plain screengrabs into professional-looking shots, excellent for showcasing your work on social media, help docs, newsletters, and blog posts.</p>
<p>You can even set custom images as your background &#8211; pick one from your system or search the web for the perfect stock image right from within the annotation window.</p>
<h2>Customize Each Background Freely</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3476 aligncenter" src="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Background-Options_1.jpg" alt="Background Options" width="1391" height="1090" srcset="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Background-Options_1.jpg 1391w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Background-Options_1-350x274.jpg 350w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Background-Options_1-1024x802.jpg 1024w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Background-Options_1-768x602.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1391px) 100vw, 1391px" /></p>
<p>Control how your screenshot is framed and where it is displayed over your chosen background.</p>
<p>The <strong>Auto-Balance</strong> feature intelligently crops your screenshot, removing empty areas and centering captured content. With the remaining customization controls, you can adjust the size of the background, the border around the screenshot, the roundness of the border’s corners, and the size of the shadow underneath the frame.</p>
<p>You can also choose to reposition your screenshot over the background using one of nine <strong>alignment</strong> options and add your very own <strong>watermark</strong> to each background. Advertise your brand name on every screenshot you share!</p>
<h2>Prepare Your Shots for Social Media</h2>
<p>With a couple of clicks, switch between wide, square, and portrait aspect ratios for your screenshot. Pick from a host of options tailored for popular social media platforms.</p>
<h2>Save Presets</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3477 aligncenter" src="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Presets_1.gif" alt="Presets" width="800" height="444" /></p>
<p>Sprucing up your screenshots doesn’t have to be time-consuming. Save your favorite customization choices as a preset that you can apply to future screenshots with a single click.</p>
<h2>Capture Scrolling Screenshots</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3478 aligncenter" src="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Capture-Scrolling-Screenshots_2.gif" alt="Scrolling Screenshots" width="800" height="444" /></p>
<p>Capture the length of an entire web page, chat, or code with the new Capture Scrolling Screenshot feature. Select an area within a scrollable window and then either scroll down manually or hit Auto Scroll to have Jumpshare create a stitched screenshot of the scrolling content.</p>
<p>The Capture Scrolling Screenshot option can be found in the More (…) menu.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3479 aligncenter" src="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Capture-Scrolling-Screenshot.jpg" alt="Capture Scrolling Screenshot" width="1300" height="700" srcset="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Capture-Scrolling-Screenshot.jpg 1300w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Capture-Scrolling-Screenshot-350x188.jpg 350w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Capture-Scrolling-Screenshot-1024x551.jpg 1024w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Capture-Scrolling-Screenshot-768x414.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1300px) 100vw, 1300px" /></p>
<h2>Automatically Redact Sensitive Information</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3480 aligncenter" src="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Automatic-Redaction_1.png" alt="Automatic Redaction" width="1483" height="930" srcset="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Automatic-Redaction_1.png 1483w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Automatic-Redaction_1-350x219.png 350w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Automatic-Redaction_1-1024x642.png 1024w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Automatic-Redaction_1-768x482.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1483px) 100vw, 1483px" /></p>
<p>Jumpshare’s screenshot tool now automatically detects sensitive information &#8211; such as email addresses, passwords, IP addresses, and credit card numbers &#8211; in your screenshots and gives you the option to hide them all with a single click.</p>
<p>The annotation window now shows a Redact Sensitive Information icon whenever such info is found in a screenshot. Click it to have a redaction mark (solid rectangle) appear over each area showing sensitive information.</p>
<p>Background Options, Scrolling Screenshots, and Automatic Redaction are available to all Jumpshare users today as part of the latest update to our Windows app (and coming soon to Mac).</p>
<p>Happy sharing!</p>

<p>Today, we’re thrilled to announce <strong>Jumpshare AI</strong>, a smart companion designed to enhance video engagement and accessibility, allowing you to concentrate all your efforts on creating and sharing videos effortlessly. Among its exciting offerings are three new features: <strong>Automatic Speaker Summary</strong>, <strong>Chapters</strong>, and <strong>Titles</strong> for your videos.</p>
<p>We’ve also added <strong>Captions Customization</strong> so you can further personalize the video player experience to match your brand.</p>
<h2>Automatic Video Title</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3454 aligncenter" src="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Automatic-Title-Jumpshare-AI.gif" alt="" width="1300" height="500" /></p>
<p>Let Jumpshare AI automatically rename your screen recordings based on their content while you focus on creating and sharing.</p>
<h2>Automatic Video Summary</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3455 aligncenter" src="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Jumpshare-Automatic-Summary.png" alt="" width="1744" height="783" srcset="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Jumpshare-Automatic-Summary.png 1744w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Jumpshare-Automatic-Summary-350x157.png 350w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Jumpshare-Automatic-Summary-1024x460.png 1024w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Jumpshare-Automatic-Summary-768x345.png 768w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Jumpshare-Automatic-Summary-1536x690.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1744px) 100vw, 1744px" /></p>
<p>Now view a textual summary for each of your videos, right below the video player. Automatically generated using the content of a video’s transcription, this description offers viewers a quick overview of what the video is about. Copy the summary and paste it anywhere you share or embed the video to ease viewers into the content.</p>
<p>Summaries are editable and only generated for videos with over 120 spoken words.</p>
<p>The Automatic Summary feature can be disabled from Settings &gt; Customize.</p>
<h2>Automatic Video Chapters</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3456 aligncenter" src="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Jumpshare-Automatic_Chapters.png" alt="" width="1696" height="881" srcset="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Jumpshare-Automatic_Chapters.png 1696w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Jumpshare-Automatic_Chapters-350x182.png 350w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Jumpshare-Automatic_Chapters-1024x532.png 1024w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Jumpshare-Automatic_Chapters-768x399.png 768w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Jumpshare-Automatic_Chapters-1536x798.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1696px) 100vw, 1696px" /></p>
<p>Add further convenience to your video viewing with Automatic Chapters. All videos with over 120 spoken words will automatically have a set amount of chapters generated for them based on the content and length of their transcriptions.</p>
<p>Simply upload a video and let Jumpshare automatically break up and label its timeline for you, making it easier for viewers to skim through the video or skip to a particular moment of interest. <a href="https://support.jumpshare.com/article/241-how-to-edit-video-chapters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Edit, add, or delete chapters</a> as needed.</p>
<p>Select a chapter to switch to by hovering your mouse over the seek bar or scrolling down below the video player.</p>
<p>Automatic Chapters are enabled by default but can be easily disabled from Settings &gt; Customize.</p>

<p>Have your videos stand out by customizing the look and behavior of their closed captions. Choose from three different caption styles. Change font and background colors to better match your custom branding. Set a font size and weight of your choice or add a text outline to increase readability for your viewers.</p>
<p>Automatic Title, Summary, and Chapters as well as Caption Customization are all available to Jumpshare Plus (with Advanced Video Pack), Business, and Enterprise subscribers.</p>
<p>We’re excited to see how Jumpshare AI helps lighten your workload and improve video engagement!</p>
<p>Happy sharing!</p>

<p>Today, we have exciting news for users who work with audio, whether it is to send messages, create notes, or record podcasts and lectures.

<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3386 aligncenter" src="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Automatic-Captions-and-Transcription-for-Audio.png" alt="Automatic Captions and Transcription for Audio" width="1709" height="1051" srcset="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Automatic-Captions-and-Transcription-for-Audio.png 1709w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Automatic-Captions-and-Transcription-for-Audio-350x215.png 350w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Automatic-Captions-and-Transcription-for-Audio-1024x630.png 1024w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Automatic-Captions-and-Transcription-for-Audio-768x472.png 768w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Automatic-Captions-and-Transcription-for-Audio-1536x945.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1709px) 100vw, 1709px" /></p>
<p>Any audio files you upload to your Jumpshare library or voice messages you record using the Jumpshare desktop app will now automatically have captions generated for them. These captions are displayed above the audio player when the Closed Captions toggle is enabled.</p>
<p>Just like with video, you can edit the generated transcription from the right sidebar and even download it for offline use. You may also search audio files by transcription, making use of the spoken words inside each voice message or podcast to find what you’re looking for.</p>
<p>Automatic Captions and Transcription is available to <a href="https://jumpshare.com/pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jumpshare Business &amp; Enterprise</a> users and as part of the <a href="https://jumpshare.com/blog/introducing-video-player-customization-video-pack-and-more/">Advanced Video Pack add-on</a> for Jumpshare Plus.</p>
<h2>All-New Audio Editor</h2>

<p>Edit your audio files visually with our intuitive new audio trimming tool, all within the comfort of your browser. Trim from the sides or remove unnecessary portions from anywhere in between, using the arrow keys on your keyboard for added precision whenever it is needed. Audio visualization makes it easier to identify and remove specific parts of an audio file, such as silences.</p>
<p>Learn how to trim your audio files <a href="https://support.jumpshare.com/article/238-how-to-trim-your-audio-files" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>The new audio editor is available to Jumpshare Plus, Business, and Enterprise users today.</p>
<p>As always, we’d love to hear how you plan to use these new features to improve your workflow and what improvements, if any, you’d like to see in future updates.</p>
<p>Happy sharing!</p>

<p>We have exciting new announcements for our premium plan subscribers. Starting today, Business and Enterprise users can customize the appearance of the Jumpshare video player to match their branding. In addition, by popular demand, we’ve made Business plan video features available to Plus plan users as part of the Advanced Video Pack add-on.</p>
<h2>Customize the Video Player to Match Your Brand</h2>
<p>Now change the color of the video player interface to match your custom branding or logo. The color you pick is applied to the play icon and seek bar for both shared and embedded videos. Head on over to <em>Settings &gt; Workspace &gt; Customize</em> to pick your color of choice.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3370 aligncenter" src="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Video-Player_Customization.gif" alt="Video Player Color Customization" width="1200" height="497" /></p>

<p>Video Player Customization is available today for Jumpshare Business and Enterprise users for free and as part of the new Video Pack add-on for Plus users.</p>
<h2>Add Business Video Features to Your Plus Plan</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-3368 size-full" src="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Advanced-Video-Pack-2.jpg" alt="Advanced Video Pack" width="1300" height="670" srcset="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Advanced-Video-Pack-2.jpg 1300w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Advanced-Video-Pack-2-350x180.jpg 350w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Advanced-Video-Pack-2-1024x528.jpg 1024w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Advanced-Video-Pack-2-768x396.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1300px) 100vw, 1300px" /></p>
<p>When we added automatic captioning and transcription for videos earlier this year, we kept it exclusive to our Business and Enterprise plans given the costs involved for such a resource-intensive feature. We’ve since received several requests for the feature to be made available to Plus users who have fewer than 3 seats.</p>
<p>With the new Advanced Video Pack add-on, Jumpshare Plus subscribers can now unlock Business video features without upgrading to the <a href="https://jumpshare.com/pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Business plan</a>. The add-on, priced at an affordable <strong>$5/member/month</strong> or <strong>$50/member/year</strong>, will get you automatic captions and transcription, the ability to search for videos by transcription, and video player customization.</p>
<p>Get the add-on today from your <a href="https://jumpshare.com/settings/workspace/customize" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Customize settings</a> page.</p>
<h2>Share in Our Earnings With the Affiliate Program</h2>
<p>If you’re a Jumpshare Plus, Business, or Enterprise user with a love for the product and wish to invite your friends or colleagues to it, you’ll be pleased to know that we now have an affiliate program!</p>
<p>Invite prospective users to upgrade to one of our premium plans using your affiliate link, and get a 20% cut of each new subscription, plus any renewals for up to a year.</p>

The Jumpshare Windows app has an all-new screen recorder, rebuilt from scratch, the Mac app now has system audio recording, and users can now switch between screen recording framerates on both.</p>
<h2>Ground-Up Remake of the Windows Screen Recorder</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3353 aligncenter" src="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/New-Jumpshare-Windows_Screen-Recorder-1.jpg" alt="" width="1366" height="754" srcset="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/New-Jumpshare-Windows_Screen-Recorder-1.jpg 1366w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/New-Jumpshare-Windows_Screen-Recorder-1-350x193.jpg 350w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/New-Jumpshare-Windows_Screen-Recorder-1-1024x565.jpg 1024w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/New-Jumpshare-Windows_Screen-Recorder-1-768x424.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1366px) 100vw, 1366px" /></p>
<p>The new, re-coded Windows screen recorder isn’t just faster, it is also far more resource-efficient. Its new core allows it to operate more as a part of the operating system than a third-party app, yielding improved overall performance at significantly lower CPU and GPU usage. Now enjoy smoother screen, webcam, and GIF recording with improved color reproduction and audio sync, even on older systems!</p>
<h2>One-Click System Audio Recording on Mac &amp; Windows</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3348 aligncenter" src="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/One-Click-System-Audio.jpg" alt="One Click System Audio" width="1300" height="650" srcset="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/One-Click-System-Audio.jpg 1300w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/One-Click-System-Audio-350x175.jpg 350w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/One-Click-System-Audio-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/One-Click-System-Audio-768x384.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1300px) 100vw, 1300px" /></p>
<p>The Jumpshare screen recorder now comes equipped with system audio recording. Record the audio being played on your system along with that from your microphone as part of all your screen recordings.</p>
<p>System audio recording can be enabled with a single click from the recording controls right before you start your screen recording. On Mac, this option is made available after a short, first-time setup from the app’s Preferences window.</p>
<p>We’ve also rebuilt the audio recorder on Windows, making it faster and more stable.</p>
<h2>Switch Between Framerates for Smoother Screen Recording</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3349 aligncenter" src="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/FPS.jpg" alt="" width="2116" height="1594" srcset="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/FPS.jpg 2116w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/FPS-350x264.jpg 350w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/FPS-1024x771.jpg 1024w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/FPS-768x579.jpg 768w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/FPS-1536x1157.jpg 1536w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/FPS-2048x1543.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2116px) 100vw, 2116px" /></p>
<p>New to both the Mac and Windows apps is the ability to switch the framerate or FPS (Frames Per Second) at which the screen recorder captures video. Now switch between 15, 30, and 60 frames per second from the app’s Preferences at any point before starting a new screen recording.</p>
<p>Higher framerates yield smoother recordings and are particularly useful for instances where you might need to capture increased on-screen activity. Lower framerates will keep the size of your screen recordings relatively smaller, though the difference isn’t significant in cases where there is low on-screen activity.</p>
<p>This is why our new default recording framerate has been set to 30 frames per second, striking the perfect balance between quality and size.</p>
<p>Both updates are available to all Jumpshare users today! Take the new screen recorder for a spin and let us know how it feels. Your feedback, as always, remains a valuable part of our development process.</p>
<p>Happy sharing!</p>

<p>Video continues to stand at the core of what drives online content and communication, which is why here at Jumpshare, we’ve been hard at work improving how you make and share the same.</p>
<p>A couple of updates ago, we added <a href="https://jumpshare.com/blog/introducing-engagement-insights-for-videos/">Engagement Insights</a> for all our premium users, and today, we’re adding another essential new feature for our <a href="https://jumpshare.com/pricing">Business and Enterprise</a> customers. Now supercharge your video viewing experience with <strong>Captions and Transcription</strong>. Have subtitles automatically generated for every video you upload, jump to specific portions of a video through a timestamped transcript, and edit captions as needed.</p>
<p>Give your audience the option to watch shared videos with closed captions enabled, making your message easier to follow.</p>
<h2>So How Does it Work?</h2>
<p>Every time you upload a new video to your library, Jumpshare will automatically begin generating captions for it using AI transcription, with the amount of time it takes to do so depending on the length and content of the video. The automatic transcription intelligently removes speech errors, false starts, and filler words, even adding appropriate punctuation where it detects pauses.</p>
<p>Once automatic transcription is done, you will be able to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Watch the video with <strong>closed captions</strong> enabled.</li>
<li>View, copy, or download the entirety of the transcript and jump to specific portions of the video from the new timestamped <strong>Transcription</strong> view.</li>
<li>Make changes to individual words in each caption using the <strong>Edit Captions</strong> option.</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3327 aligncenter" src="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Transcription-and-Edit-Captions-options.png" alt="Transcription and Edit Captions options" width="1300" height="770" srcset="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Transcription-and-Edit-Captions-options.png 1300w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Transcription-and-Edit-Captions-options-350x207.png 350w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Transcription-and-Edit-Captions-options-1024x607.png 1024w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Transcription-and-Edit-Captions-options-768x455.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1300px) 100vw, 1300px" /></p>
<p>Being able to quickly browse through content within each video using its timestamped transcript should prove to be particularly handy for longer videos that your recipients may not be able to watch in one sitting.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3324 aligncenter" src="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Transcription-and_Edit-Captions-Screenshot.png" alt="Transcription and Edit Captions" width="1501" height="1081" srcset="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Transcription-and_Edit-Captions-Screenshot.png 1501w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Transcription-and_Edit-Captions-Screenshot-350x252.png 350w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Transcription-and_Edit-Captions-Screenshot-1024x737.png 1024w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Transcription-and_Edit-Captions-Screenshot-768x553.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1501px) 100vw, 1501px" /></p>
<p>Use the Edit Captions option to correct mistakes in your recording or portions of the video where the automatic transcription isn’t able to parse the speech.</p>
<p>Closed captions will be enabled by default for each of your videos but you may click the “CC” toggle in the video player to turn them off.</p>
<p>Captions and Transcription is available today for all <a href="https://jumpshare.com/pricing">Business and Enterprise plan subscribers</a>. We&#8217;ve also added <span class="discussion-level-1 discussion-id-c7798d2f-e1b6-48fe-bbf6-7c388f9e3637 notion-enable-hover" data-token-index="0">an improved theater mode for</span> the video player so you can expand videos to take up more space within the file viewer. As always, we&#8217;d love to hear how the new feature is helping improve traction on your videos.</p>
<p>Happy sharing!</p>

<h2>Version History Update</h2>
<p>Now upload new versions of the same file directly from its context menu. Right-click a file in your library or open it and click the More (three-dot) button, then select <strong><span class="notion-enable-hover" data-token-index="1">Version History</span></strong> &gt; <strong><span class="notion-enable-hover" data-token-index="3">Upload New Version</span></strong>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3297 aligncenter" style="border: 1px solid #ddd;" src="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Upload-New-Version-Jumpshare.gif" alt="Upload New Version" width="1390" height="780" /></p>
<p>Any time you wish to restore an older version of the same file, you can do so from <strong>Version History</strong> &gt; <strong>View Version History</strong>.</p>
<p>Previously, you could only update a file by uploading another of the same name. With this new way to swap versions, the updated file doesn’t need to have the same name as the original &#8211; only the same format. Both the content and name of the original file will be replaced by the new one without breaking its sharing link or wiping its comment history.</p>
<h2>CTA Improvements</h2>
<p>Call-to-action buttons can now be repositioned to any of the four corners of a video. We&#8217;ve added a new <strong>Button location </strong>dropdown to the CTA panel that lets you choose between four locations for the button: Top-right, Top-left, Bottom-left, and Bottom-right.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3298 aligncenter" style="border: 1px solid #ddd;" src="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Button-location.jpg" alt="" width="1859" height="1174" srcset="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Button-location.jpg 1859w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Button-location-350x221.jpg 350w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Button-location-1024x647.jpg 1024w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Button-location-768x485.jpg 768w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Button-location-1536x970.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1859px) 100vw, 1859px" /></p>
<p>You may now also choose to only show the CTA button when the video finishes playing, in which case, it is automatically displayed at the center of the video.</p>
<p>Both changes are live right now, and as always, we&#8217;d love to hear your thoughts on them.</p>
<p>Happy sharing!</p>

<h2>Track Completion Rate</h2>
<p>In addition to views and downloads, you can now monitor what percentage of a shared video has been viewed by your audience on average. Gauge how well your videos are able to retain your viewers’ attention.</p>
<p>Click the <strong>View engagement</strong> button at the bottom of the activity section to the right of the file viewer or select your video from the Analytics page.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3288 aligncenter" src="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Engagement-Insights-for-Videos.gif" alt="How it works" width="1056" height="693" /></p>

<p>Video is a fundamental part of Jumpshare’s visual communication toolset, which makes this new feature a key addition to help you better understand how your shared videos are received and tailor your content for your core demographic.</p>

<p>Today, we’re excited to launch an essential feature for users on our Enterprise plan &#8211; single sign-on (SSO). Companies looking to consolidate and streamline authentication across all of their daily-use apps can finally add Jumpshare to their SSO umbrella.</p>
<h2>What Is SSO and Why Is It Important?</h2>
<p>Single sign-on is an authentication process that allows users to log into several different apps and services at once using one set of credentials. Being able to use a single username and password for all applications used by your team has numerous benefits. Apart from eliminating the need to remember multiple passwords, it improves productivity by reducing the amount of time team members have to spend logging in and out of multiple apps on a daily basis.</p>
<p>It also simplifies the administration of user privileges, reduces IT costs, and solidifies security. With user credentials stored and managed in one place, admins can onboard new hires and edit access privileges in seconds. Users have fewer passwords to forget, which means less time spent by IT support staff handling password reset requests. The risk of phishing attacks is lowered significantly as well, with users no longer required to authenticate at multiple third-party sites on a daily basis.</p>
<p>The aforementioned only scratches the surface, of course. It should come as no surprise that SSO is one of the most oft-requested enterprise features.</p>
<h2>So How Does It Work?</h2>
<p>We&#8217;ve partnered with WorkOS to offer <strong>20+ SSO identity providers</strong>, including Okta, Google SAML, Microsoft Azure SAML, OneLogin, and Auth0. Once SSO is set up for your Jumpshare Enterprise workspace, access to the app can be managed at the chosen provider.</p>
<p>At launch, you may enable SSO against a single company domain name, but we’re already hard at work adding support for multiple domains!</p>

<p>SSO is the latest product of our commitment to offering best-in-class enterprise solutions to our customers. We thank our Enterprise customers for choosing us and pledge to take your user experience to greater heights in the weeks and months to follow. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f680.png" alt="🚀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
