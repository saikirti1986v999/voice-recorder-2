<p>Taking and sharing screenshots can be tricky if there is sensitive information in the area you want to capture. You could always use your operating system&#8217;s built-in image annotation tools to hide. Having to do so manually for several screenshots or images at a time isn&#8217;t exactly convenient, however.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://jumpshare.com/downloading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jumpshare</a> desktop app automatically detects sensitive information, namely <strong>email addresses</strong>, <strong>passwords</strong>, <strong>IP addresses</strong>, and <strong>credit card numbers</strong>, in screenshots and lets you hide all instances with a single click inside the annotation window.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how to hide sensitive information from screenshots using Jumpshare’s <a href="https://jumpshare.com/blog/make-your-screenshots-pop-with-gorgeous-backgrounds-take-scrolling-shots-and-auto-hide-sensitive-info/">automatic redaction feature</a>.</p>
<h2>How to Automatically Redact Sensitive Information from Screenshots</h2>
<p>1. Launch Jumpshare and select <strong>Capture</strong> to take a screenshot. When you’re done, your screenshot will be opened in the annotation window.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3489 aligncenter" src="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Jumpshare-capture.jpg" alt="Capture Screenshot" width="1300" height="700" srcset="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Jumpshare-capture.jpg 1300w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Jumpshare-capture-350x188.jpg 350w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Jumpshare-capture-1024x551.jpg 1024w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Jumpshare-capture-768x414.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1300px) 100vw, 1300px" /></p>
<p>Alternatively, you may open an existing image in Jumpshare&#8217;s annotation window by right-clicking the image and selecting Annotate with Jumpshare from its context menu.</p>
<p>2. If the screenshot or image contains sensitive information, the <strong>Redact Sensitive Information</strong> icon will appear in the toolbar at the top of the window. Click on this icon to hide all detected sensitive info behind editable redaction marks.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3518 aligncenter" src="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Automatic-Redaction_1.jpg" alt="Automatically hide sensitive info" width="1483" height="930" srcset="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Automatic-Redaction_1.jpg 1483w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Automatic-Redaction_1-350x219.jpg 350w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Automatic-Redaction_1-1024x642.jpg 1024w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Automatic-Redaction_1-768x482.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1483px) 100vw, 1483px" /></p>
<p>3. You may now, if you feel like you need to, modify these redaction marks individually. Click on a redaction mark in the screenshot and use the handles around it to adjust its size, drag it around to change its position, pick another color for it using the color picker in the toolbar above, or hit Delete to remove it completely.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3517 aligncenter" src="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Automatic-Redaction_edit_2.jpg" alt="Edit" width="1483" height="930" srcset="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Automatic-Redaction_edit_2.jpg 1483w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Automatic-Redaction_edit_2-350x219.jpg 350w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Automatic-Redaction_edit_2-1024x642.jpg 1024w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Automatic-Redaction_edit_2-768x482.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1483px) 100vw, 1483px" /></p>
<p>Note that partially obscured instances of sensitive information in your images or screenshots, such as a half-hidden email address, may at times remain unhidden. You may have to hide such instances manually. It’s important to <strong>double-check your screenshot or image for unhidden sensitive info</strong> before sharing it with others.</p>
<p>To manually hide any instance of sensitive info using the same redaction marks as the Redact Sensitive Information feature, pick the Solid Square tool from the toolbar. To hide larger sections while still letting viewers see the layout of hidden elements, use the Pixelate or Blur tools.</p>

There are, however, limitations to what you can capture using a typical screenshot. Capturing scrolling shots, for example, isn’t possible through usual means. This is where <a href="https://jumpshare.com/downloading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jumpshare</a> comes in. With Jumpshare’s desktop app, you can capture a screenshot of everything within any scrollable window, top to bottom. The app takes multiple shots of the scrollable area and stitches them vertically.</p>
<p><a href="https://jumpshare.com/blog/make-your-screenshots-pop-with-gorgeous-backgrounds-take-scrolling-shots-and-auto-hide-sensitive-info/">Scrolling screenshots</a> are excellent for sharing website designs, comment threads, chat logs, and code, and with Jumpshare, you can visually communicate your feedback over each shot with a host of powerful annotation tools before you send it to your intended recipients.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how to take a scrolling screenshot using Jumpshare.</p>
<h2>Capturing a Scrolling Screenshot</h2>
<p>1. Launch Jumpshare by clicking the kangaroo icon in the notification area.</p>
<p>2. Click the <strong>More (&#8230;)</strong> option and select <strong>Capture Scrolling Screenshot</strong>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3510 aligncenter" src="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Capture-Scrolling-Screenshot-1.jpg" alt="Capture Scrolling Screenshot" width="1300" height="700" srcset="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Capture-Scrolling-Screenshot-1.jpg 1300w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Capture-Scrolling-Screenshot-1-350x188.jpg 350w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Capture-Scrolling-Screenshot-1-1024x551.jpg 1024w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Capture-Scrolling-Screenshot-1-768x414.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1300px) 100vw, 1300px" /></p>
<p>3. Drag an area over a scrollable window that you want to capture and hit <strong>Start Capture</strong>. Ensure that only the scrollable area is selected and that any static or hovering elements are excluded from this area if possible.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3511 aligncenter" src="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Start-Capture_1.jpg" alt="Start Capture" width="1404" height="949" srcset="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Start-Capture_1.jpg 1404w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Start-Capture_1-350x237.jpg 350w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Start-Capture_1-1024x692.jpg 1024w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Start-Capture_1-768x519.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1404px) 100vw, 1404px" /></p>
<p>4. Click the <strong>Auto-Scroll</strong> button and Jumpshare will automatically scroll downwards while showing you a live preview of the screenshot to the right of the capture area. Do not move your mouse while Auto-Scroll is active unless you wish to pause scrolling.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you may scroll downwards manually. If you choose to use manual scrolling, try not to scroll too fast. Steadily roll your mouse wheel down once and wait for the preview on the right to be updated before you scroll again.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3508 aligncenter" src="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Capture-Scrolling-Screenshots_2-1.gif" alt="Scrolling Screenshot" width="800" height="444" /></p>
<p>5. Hit the <strong>Finish</strong> button when you’re done. This will open your screenshot within the annotation window, where you can crop out parts of the shot, highlight areas of interest, hide sensitive information, or turn your shot into a shareable image by <a href="https://jumpshare.com/blog/screenshot-background/">adding a gorgeous background</a>.</p>
<p>6. When you’re done editing and annotating, hit <strong>Upload</strong> to save the scrolling screenshot to your Jumpshare library. A link to the uploaded image will automatically be copied to your clipboard, ready to be shared anywhere!</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3512 aligncenter" src="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Upload_1.jpg" alt="Upload" width="1300" height="408" srcset="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Upload_1.jpg 1300w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Upload_1-350x110.jpg 350w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Upload_1-1024x321.jpg 1024w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Upload_1-768x241.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1300px) 100vw, 1300px" /></p>

<p>Fortunately, there are tools out there meant to help you take screenshots fit to be shared anywhere. The powerful <a href="https://jumpshare.com/blog/make-your-screenshots-pop-with-gorgeous-backgrounds-take-scrolling-shots-and-auto-hide-sensitive-info/">Background Options tool</a> in Jumpshare’s very own screenshot annotation toolset is a prime example. In a few simple clicks, this feature can add a beautiful background to your screengrabs, turning even the most bland-looking shots into something you could proudly display on your product’s social media page.</p>
<h2>Adding a Background to Screenshots</h2>
<p>1. Launch <a href="https://jumpshare.com/downloading" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jumpshare</a> and select <strong>Capture</strong> to take a screenshot. When you’re done, your screenshot will be opened within the annotation window.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3489 aligncenter" src="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Jumpshare-capture.jpg" alt="Capture Screenshot" width="1300" height="700" srcset="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Jumpshare-capture.jpg 1300w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Jumpshare-capture-350x188.jpg 350w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Jumpshare-capture-1024x551.jpg 1024w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Jumpshare-capture-768x414.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1300px) 100vw, 1300px" /></p>
<p>2. Click the icon at the extreme left of the tools at the top of the window to open the <strong>Background Options</strong> panel.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3490 aligncenter" src="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Background-Options_2.jpg" alt="Background Options" width="1300" height="616" srcset="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Background-Options_2.jpg 1300w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Background-Options_2-350x166.jpg 350w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Background-Options_2-1024x485.jpg 1024w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Background-Options_2-768x364.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1300px) 100vw, 1300px" /></p>
<p>3. Pick your background. You may choose one of the 10 beautiful pre-made gradients from under the <strong>Background</strong> section, click the “+” icon to pick an image from your system, or search stock images from within the annotation window. You may also select a <strong>Solid Color</strong> from the section below.</p>
<p>4. Customize your background.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3491 aligncenter" src="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Background-Adjustments.gif" alt="Background Adjustments" width="800" height="480" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Move the <strong>Padding</strong> slider to adjust the size of the background.</li>
<li>Move the <strong>Inset</strong> slider to adjust the size of the border around your screenshot. The color of this border is set automatically based on the content of your screenshot, specifically close to its edges. For example, if there is one solid color around the edges of your screenshot, the border will be the same color.</li>
<li>Move the <strong>Rounded</strong> slider to make the edges of the screenshot’s border more or less curved.</li>
<li>Move the <strong>Shadow</strong> slider to adjust the size of the shadow that appears under the screenshot.</li>
</ul>
<p>5. Enable the <strong>Auto-balance</strong> option to intelligently remove any empty areas or fluff from your screenshot and draw focus to what’s important.</p>

<p>6. Choose where on the background you want your screenshot to appear by selecting one of the 9 options under <strong>Alignment</strong>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3493 aligncenter" src="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Alignment.jpg" alt="Alignment" width="1300" height="487" srcset="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Alignment.jpg 1300w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Alignment-350x131.jpg 350w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Alignment-1024x384.jpg 1024w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Alignment-768x288.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1300px) 100vw, 1300px" /></p>
<p>7. Open up the <strong>Ratio</strong> drop-down menu to change the aspect ratio of your screenshot so it may better suit your target platform. For example, if you&#8217;re going to share your screenshot on Instagram, you may want to select the option by the same name or the Square (1:1) option.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3494 aligncenter" src="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Aspect-Ratio.jpg" alt="Aspect Ratio" width="1300" height="873" srcset="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Aspect-Ratio.jpg 1300w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Aspect-Ratio-350x235.jpg 350w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Aspect-Ratio-1024x688.jpg 1024w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Aspect-Ratio-768x516.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1300px) 100vw, 1300px" /></p>
<p>8. Finally, you may choose to add your name or branding to the screenshot by typing it out in the <strong>Watermark</strong> field.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3495 aligncenter" src="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Watermark.jpg" alt="Watermark" width="1300" height="700" srcset="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Watermark.jpg 1300w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Watermark-350x188.jpg 350w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Watermark-1024x551.jpg 1024w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Watermark-768x414.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1300px) 100vw, 1300px" /></p>
<p>If you’re unhappy with the result and want to start over, simply hit the <strong>Reset</strong> button at the top. If you’re ready to share, hit the <strong>Upload</strong> button to save the screenshot to your Jumpshare library and have its link automatically copied to your clipboard. You may now paste this link anywhere you wish to share the screenshot.</p>
<h2>Saving and Applying Background Presets</h2>
<p>If you love your spruced-up new screenshot and could see yourself using the same background for future shots, consider saving your settings as a preset before you hit that Upload button. Here’s what you need to do to save a new preset.</p>
<p>1. After you’ve picked a background and made all required changes to it within the Background Options panel, click the “+” icon next to the <strong>Presets</strong> drop-down menu.</p>
<p>2. Enter a name for your preset and click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3500 aligncenter" src="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Save-Preset.jpg" alt="Save Preset" width="1300" height="512" srcset="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Save-Preset.jpg 1300w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Save-Preset-350x138.jpg 350w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Save-Preset-1024x403.jpg 1024w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Save-Preset-768x302.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1300px) 100vw, 1300px" /></p>
<p>3. For future screenshots, simply open the <strong>Presets</strong> drop-down and select your saved preset from the list.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3499 aligncenter" src="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Preset-Select.jpg" alt="Preset Select" width="1300" height="512" srcset="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Preset-Select.jpg 1300w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Preset-Select-350x138.jpg 350w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Preset-Select-1024x403.jpg 1024w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Preset-Select-768x302.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1300px) 100vw, 1300px" /></p>
<p>To delete any preset you’ve saved, select it from the drop-down and hit the delete icon to the right.</p>

In a primarily textual medium like <a href="https://jumpshare.com/blog/what-is-slack-and-why-does-your-team-need-it/">Slack</a>, words may convey their meaning but they also tend to lose their tone. That&#8217;s why we have those tiny images everyone calls emojis.</p>
<p>Out of the box, Slack offers all of the emojis in the Unicode standard, but sometimes the usual list of emojis, as exhaustive as it is, just doesn&#8217;t cut it. For those instances, Slack users have the option to add their very own emoji to the mix or pick from a number of sets made specifically for the app. You can even set multiple alternative names for each of these emojis just to make remembering them easier. Continue reading to learn how.</p>
<h2>How to Add Custom Emoji to Slack</h2>
<p>Any member of your workspace can add custom emojis to it. There are some limits in place for these that bear mentioning, however. You may only upload JPG, PNG, or GIF formats with up to a maximum size of 128KB. Animated GIFs must be 50 frames or less in length. Slack recommends 128x128px square images. The app will automatically resize your image if it doesn’t match the recommended dimensions.</p>
<p>Emojis can only be added from Slack’s desktop and web apps.</p>
<p>1. Open the Slack app or website on your computer.</p>
<p>2. In the message field at the bottom, click the Emoji (smiley face) icon.</p>
<p>3. Click the <strong>Add Emoji</strong> button in the bottom-left corner of the Emoji menu.</p>

<h2>How to Use Custom Slack Emoji</h2>
<p>After a custom emoji has been added to your Slack workspace, you can find it by entering the name you chose for it in the <strong>emoji menu search bar</strong>.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you may add the new emoji to your messages on the fly by <strong>typing a colon (:)</strong> followed by its name. The app will show you matching emojis in a pop-up as you start typing in the name.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3125 aligncenter" src="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/How-to-use-custom-Slack-Emoji.png" alt="How to use custom Slack Emoji" width="1300" height="400" srcset="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/How-to-use-custom-Slack-Emoji.png 1300w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/How-to-use-custom-Slack-Emoji-350x108.png 350w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/How-to-use-custom-Slack-Emoji-1024x315.png 1024w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/How-to-use-custom-Slack-Emoji-768x236.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1300px) 100vw, 1300px" /></p>
<p>For instances when you’re simply unsure which custom emoji to use, here’s how you can view a list of all custom emojis in the workspace.</p>
<ol>
<li>In the message field at the bottom of the app, click the Emoji icon.</li>
<li>Select the right-most icon (the Slack logo) from above the search bar.</li>

<h2>How to Remove an Emoji Pack from Slack</h2>

<ol>

<h2>How to Create Emoji Aliases in Slack</h2>
<h3>What is an Emoji Alias?</h3>

<p>2. Click the workspace name in the top-left corner of the app.</p>
<p>3. Select <strong>Customize [Workspace]</strong> from the workspace menu or Settings &amp; administration &gt; Customize [Workspace] if you have an Owner or Admin role.</p>

Whether you are learning a new skill or collaborating with your colleagues, online meetings are a constant in most people’s lives. Despite being normalized, most people still struggle with being themselves in front of a camera. Between continuously glancing at your own face to not knowing which way to look, video calls can be a nightmare for some. It is surprising how even the most skilled communicators can start to feel awkward and camera-shy once the webcam light turns on. Regardless of the high rates of adoption, video is still a new medium for most of us.</p>
<p>Similar to public speaking, video communication can make us feel vulnerable in the beginning. Here are a few tips and tricks to help you get acclimated to the world of online meetings in no time!</p>
<h2>Tips to Overcome Being Camera Shy</h2>
<p>The good news for camera-shy people is that like any other skill, being confident in front of the camera is a skill that can be learned and eventually mastered. Here are a few tips for being more confident in front of the webcam.</p>
<h3>Use the “Mirror Image” or &#8220;Flip Camera&#8221; Option</h3>
<p>As a default, we are used to seeing ourselves in front of a mirror and might feel uncomfortable seeing ourselves in a webcam when the image isn&#8217;t flipped. That is because our faces are not symmetrical and our facial expressions appear different when not being seen in a mirror. Luckily, most video conferencing apps like Zoom have an image flip option that allows you to view your video as if it were mirrored, allowing you to get more comfortable with online video calls.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-3090 size-full" src="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Zoom-Mirror-Image-flip-camera.jpg" alt="&quot;Mirror my video&quot; option in Zoom " width="1300" height="1085" srcset="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Zoom-Mirror-Image-flip-camera.jpg 1300w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Zoom-Mirror-Image-flip-camera-350x292.jpg 350w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Zoom-Mirror-Image-flip-camera-1024x855.jpg 1024w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Zoom-Mirror-Image-flip-camera-768x641.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1300px) 100vw, 1300px" /></p>
<h3>Look Your Best</h3>
<p>One of the easiest ways to get a confidence boost is to look your best. Just because people can&#8217;t see you fully in video meetings doesn&#8217;t mean that you should skimp on your overall appearance. The way you dress not only makes an instant impression on your colleagues but also gives people an insight into how seriously you take your work. So instead of looking like you just jumped out of bed to attend a meeting, get ready for your video conference calls just as you would for any in-person meeting. The serotonin released from looking your best will carry into your meeting and help you perform your best.</p>
<h3>Use &#8220;Touchup&#8221; Filters</h3>
<p>Sometimes you just can&#8217;t help but feel a little conscious of that tiny scar or untimely blemish. For those moments, popular video meeting apps offer touchup filters that apply a smoothing effect to your skin. You shouldn&#8217;t ever feel that you <em>need </em>to use filters, but if it helps give you a tiny boost of confidence when you&#8217;re feeling particularly anxious, you needn&#8217;t shy away from the solution either.</p>
<p><span id="more-3070"></span></p>
<h3>Set Up a Meeting Area</h3>
<p>Having a good setup is imperative to a seamless online meeting. From making sure your camera and microphone are working to ensuring that your background is clean and that your room has good lighting, setting up a meeting area is made up of several small tasks. Try to join the meeting a bit early so that you can see how your background looks, in case it needs any adjustments.</p>
<p>A pro tip for background management is that you can choose to <a href="https://jumpshare.com/blog/how-to-blur-background-in-zoom/">blur your background in Zoom</a>, Google Meet, and other similar video meeting apps in just a few clicks, preventing your colleagues from seeing the clutter in your background. You can even <a href="https://jumpshare.com/blog/how-to-change-background-on-zoom/">swap out the background</a> completely.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-2968 aligncenter" src="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/How-to-Blur-Background-in-Zoom.jpg" alt="" width="1300" height="731" srcset="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/How-to-Blur-Background-in-Zoom.jpg 1300w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/How-to-Blur-Background-in-Zoom-350x197.jpg 350w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/How-to-Blur-Background-in-Zoom-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/How-to-Blur-Background-in-Zoom-768x432.jpg 768w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/How-to-Blur-Background-in-Zoom-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1300px) 100vw, 1300px" /></p>
<h3>Slow Down, Practice</h3>
<p>If you are prone to camera anxiety, it is probable that you subconsciously speed up the rate at which you are talking on camera. When you are taking an online meeting, try to make a conscious effort to slow down your speech.</p>
<p>A good way to practice this is by familiarizing yourself with talking through your webcam by recording video messages using a <a href="https://jumpshare.com/screen-recorder">screen recorder like Jumpshare</a>. You can start by setting an agenda for your message and maybe even note down some talking points before you start recording. By going through the motions of a meeting on your own terms, you can soothe your anxiety and get over your camera phobia.</p>
<h3>Minimize Distractions</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3094 aligncenter" src="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Video-Meeting.jpg" alt="" width="1300" height="725" srcset="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Video-Meeting.jpg 1300w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Video-Meeting-350x195.jpg 350w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Video-Meeting-1024x571.jpg 1024w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Video-Meeting-768x428.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1300px) 100vw, 1300px" /></p>
<p>When you are talking face-to-face with a person, you give them your full attention. The same principle should be true in online meetings. Before starting an online meeting, close all your apps and disable your notifications to make sure you are not disrupted by an untimely email or Slack notification. To be on the safe side, you should also close any unrelated browser tabs in case you need to share your screen with a team member.</p>
<h3>Always Be Yourself</h3>
<p>Instead of trying to perfect your speech into a robotic monologue, try to give yourself permission to be human. One of the best ways to break through the waves of anxiety is to allow yourself to have fun. Connect with your coworkers with a funny virtual background, make jokes, and smile sincerely, and you are well on your way to a fun and successful online meeting!</p>
<p>Video meetings are like just any other meeting. They might seem daunting at first, but with the right tools and practice, you will be on your way to stress-free online meetings in no time! If not, you could always stick to asynchronous visual communication and skip meetings altogether.</p>

From socializing to networking, everyone spends a good chunk of their day scrolling and exploring all that the internet has to offer. With thousands of videos posted every day, Reddit is one of the biggest social media websites that banks on visual communication to connect people from across the world. From entrepreneurial advice to gameplay tips and tricks, Reddit has it all. But what good is advice if it gets lost in an endless loop of content consumption? Like most social platforms, Reddit does not allow you to simply right-click a video and download it onto your phone or laptop. If you want to download a Reddit video to view later, you&#8217;ll need help from a few extra tools.</p>
<p>Whether you need to download a useful hack or an adorable cat video to share in a group thread, we have got you covered. Here are the easiest ways to download and save Reddit videos to your device.</p>
<h2>Use a Reddit Video Downloader</h2>

From productivity hacks to entertaining dog videos, TikTok is flooded with fresh, shareable content every single day. A huge reason for TikTok’s sudden rise to fame is how easy it is to share TikTok’s content across multiple social media platforms. Whether you&#8217;ve recorded a video that you want to share with your friends, or you&#8217;ve stumbled upon something you want to view again at a later time, you&#8217;ll find TikTok’s sharing and downloading controls to be incredibly user-friendly.</p>
<h2>How to Share a TikTok Video via Link</h2>
<ol>
<li>Open the TikTok app or website and open the video you would like to share.</li>
<li>If it’s your own video, tap on the three-dot icon at the bottom-right of the screen to open the sharing screen. If it’s another user’s video, click on the share icon. You will be presented with several options to share your TikTok video.</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Copy Link</strong> icon. TikTok will copy the link to your clipboard for easy sharing.</li>
<li>Paste the link wherever you&#8217;d like to share the video.</li>
</ol>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3052 aligncenter" src="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/How-to-Share-TikTok-via-Link.jpg" alt="How to Share TikTok via Link" width="1300" height="842" srcset="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/How-to-Share-TikTok-via-Link.jpg 1300w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/How-to-Share-TikTok-via-Link-300x194.jpg 300w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/How-to-Share-TikTok-via-Link-1024x663.jpg 1024w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/How-to-Share-TikTok-via-Link-768x497.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1300px) 100vw, 1300px" /></p>
<p>When sharing a TikTok video on a desktop system, all you need to do is hover over the share icon and click on the <strong>Copy Link</strong> option. A shareable link will be copied to your clipboard.</p>
<p><span id="more-3027"></span></p>
<h2>How to Share a TikTok Video on Social Media</h2>
<p>You can share a TikTok video on other social media channels by following a few simple steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the TikTok app and tap on the video you want to share.</li>
<li>If you are sharing your own video, tap the three-dot icon at the bottom-right of your screen. Tap on the arrow icon if you are sharing someone else’s video.</li>
<li>Several sharing options will pop up. Choose between multiple social media and messaging platforms like Instagram, Facebook, Messenger, and Whatsapp.</li>
<li>You can choose between sharing the video in a message or as a post on your feed. The video will be shared as a link.</li>
</ol>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3054 aligncenter" src="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/How-to-share-TikTok-on-Facebook-Instagram-Whatsapp-1.png" alt="How to Share TikTok on Facebook Instagram and Whatsapp" width="1125" height="571" srcset="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/How-to-share-TikTok-on-Facebook-Instagram-Whatsapp-1.png 1125w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/How-to-share-TikTok-on-Facebook-Instagram-Whatsapp-1-300x152.png 300w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/How-to-share-TikTok-on-Facebook-Instagram-Whatsapp-1-1024x520.png 1024w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/How-to-share-TikTok-on-Facebook-Instagram-Whatsapp-1-768x390.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1125px) 100vw, 1125px" /></p>
<p>If you are using the desktop version of TikTok, hover over the share icon and select the social media platform to which you want to share your video. Choose between sharing it on your feed, story, or as a message, and share away!</p>
<h2>Share a TikTok Story on Facebook and Instagram</h2>
<p>TikTok stories are a quick way to capture and share something with your followers. Like stories on Instagram, Facebook and Snapchat, TikTok stories only last for a span of 24 hours, making them great for sharing things that you want to share but don’t want to linger around on your profile. Unlike TikTok videos, which offer several choices for reposting, downloading, and sharing content, TikTok stories have limited sharing options. You can share your TikTok story by following a few simple steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Tap on a user&#8217;s profile picture to open up their profile or hit the profile icon on the bottom-right of the screen to open your own.</li>
<li>Tap on the profile picture at the top of the screen to view the latest stories.</li>
<li>While viewing the story you want to share, tap on the three-dot icon in the bottom-right corner.</li>
<li>Choose your preferred sharing option and your TikTok story will be shared instantly!</li>
</ol>

<h2>How to Download a TikTok Video</h2>
<p>If you want to share a TikTok as a video instead of a link, you will have to download the video and then upload it to your choice of social media. Here&#8217;s how you can download a TikTok video.</p>
<ol>
<li>Launch the TikTok app on your mobile device and tap on the video you want to download.</li>
<li>Hit the share icon (or three-dot icon, if it&#8217;s your own TikTok) on the right side of your screen.</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Save Video</strong> option from the pop-up menu.</li>
<li>The TikTok video will be saved to your phone’s local storage with the TikTok logo watermark and the creator&#8217;s TikTok handle.</li>
</ol>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3055 aligncenter" src="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/How-to-download-or-save-TikTok-videos.png" alt="How to download or save TikTok videos" width="1125" height="571" srcset="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/How-to-download-or-save-TikTok-videos.png 1125w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/How-to-download-or-save-TikTok-videos-300x152.png 300w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/How-to-download-or-save-TikTok-videos-1024x520.png 1024w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/How-to-download-or-save-TikTok-videos-768x390.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1125px) 100vw, 1125px" /></p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>While a video is downloading, you&#8217;ll see a progress bar at the bottom of the screen, complete with a <strong>Cancel </strong>button to stop the download.</p>
<p>Unlike the sharing options, TikTok’s Download option is not available on desktop platforms. If you want to download TikTok videos on your desktop, you can use a third-party service like <em>SaveTT.cc</em> and <em>downtik.to</em> or simply <a href="https://jumpshare.com/screen-recorder">record your screen with Jumpshare</a>. Simply run Jumpshare on your system, click on the record option, drag an area over your screen, and start recording.</p>
<h2>How to Share a TikTok on YouTube</h2>
<p>It is no secret that video reigns supreme as the medium of choice for both creators and viewers. It is nearly impossible to keep creating new content for every platform. That is where repurposing your content comes into play. You can record and edit a video on TikTok, and post it on YouTube without any added hassle. Here’s how to make the most out of your TikTok and repost it on YouTube.</p>
<ol>
<li>Launch the TikTok app and navigate to the video you want to upload to YouTube.</li>
<li>Tap on the share icon, and then <strong>Save Video</strong> to download the video.</li>
<li>Launch the YouTube app, click on the <strong>Plus</strong> icon at the bottom of the screen and choose the video you want to upload.</li>
<li>Add a title and description for your video, select your visibility, and upload your TikTok as a YouTube video or short.</li>
</ol>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3056 aligncenter" src="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Share-or-Repost-TikTok-video-to-YouTube.jpg" alt="Share or Repost TikTok video to YouTube" width="1300" height="944" srcset="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Share-or-Repost-TikTok-video-to-YouTube.jpg 1300w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Share-or-Repost-TikTok-video-to-YouTube-300x218.jpg 300w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Share-or-Repost-TikTok-video-to-YouTube-1024x744.jpg 1024w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Share-or-Repost-TikTok-video-to-YouTube-768x558.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1300px) 100vw, 1300px" /></p>
<h2>How to Add a CTA Button to a TikTok Video</h2>
<p>Short and direct, TikTok videos can be a great marketing tool if wielded properly. From unboxing videos to a product demo, a TikTok can answer several questions in the span of a few seconds if done right. However, what good is a marketing video if it isn&#8217;t able to direct viewers to your product or service? To make the most of your TikTok video, you can download it and use Jumpshare to add a CTA button to the video.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3057 aligncenter" src="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Jumpshare-Call-To-Action-for-TikTok-videos.jpg" alt="Jumpshare Call-To-Action for TikTok videos" width="1300" height="732" srcset="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Jumpshare-Call-To-Action-for-TikTok-videos.jpg 1300w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Jumpshare-Call-To-Action-for-TikTok-videos-300x169.jpg 300w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Jumpshare-Call-To-Action-for-TikTok-videos-1024x577.jpg 1024w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Jumpshare-Call-To-Action-for-TikTok-videos-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1300px) 100vw, 1300px" /></p>
<p>A call-to-action button can increase your chances for lead generation, helping you redirect your audience to a website, blog, or shop. The size, shape, and text of the CTA button are fully customizable to make sure that it is in line with your brand identity.</p>

With 80% of online traffic being attributed to video content, the time to start making videos is now. The mode of communication has invariably shifted from text and images to videos and live streams. While social media platforms are inundated with video, there is a lot of effort that goes into orchestrating the perfect video clip. From recording video clips to editing, there are several transformative steps that go on behind the scenes to turn raw data into something meaningful.</p>
<p>After fine-tuning your video to perfection, it seems futile to just upload it to a few social media platforms. To make sure that your video actualizes its true potential, you can repurpose your content across several additional platforms by using Google Drive’s embed feature.</p>
<h2>Why Would You Embed Videos With Google Drive?</h2>
<p>Whether you are sharing files with a select group of people or publicly, Google Drive enables you to deliver the impact through your content. It offers a comprehensive set of features that can help you store your videos, share them, and restrict your audience. You can also use the platform as a way to store and share large, uncompressed video files, such as those you might use in a video editing project. Just like the YouTube player, Google Drive&#8217;s video player lets you adjust playback quality and speed. You can even add captions to your videos.</p>
<p>There is a little bit more control to be had here compared to public video hosting solutions like YouTube. While unlisted or <a href="https://jumpshare.com/blog/how-to-share-a-private-youtube-video/">private YouTube videos</a> might be enough for the average user&#8217;s embedding needs, Drive might be the route to go if you&#8217;re looking for that extra bit of command over your content. For example, with Drive, you can update an embedded video without having to go back and edit the website or landing page. Drive lets you replace an existing video with a newer version or revert back to older versions of the same video file at any point. You could use this to, say, seamlessly update video promos on marketing pages.</p>
<p><span id="more-3032"></span></p>
<h2>How to Get Embed Code for a Google Drive Video</h2>
<p>You can embed a Google Drive video on any web page by following a few simple steps:</p>
<p>1. Log in to Google Drive and locate the video you want to embed.</p>
<p>2. Right-click on the video and select the <strong>Get Link</strong> option.</p>

<p>3. Change the general access controls to <strong>Anyone with the link</strong>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3040 aligncenter" src="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Change-link-access-Google-Drive.jpg" alt="" width="1300" height="976" srcset="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Change-link-access-Google-Drive.jpg 1300w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Change-link-access-Google-Drive-300x225.jpg 300w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Change-link-access-Google-Drive-1024x769.jpg 1024w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Change-link-access-Google-Drive-768x577.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1300px) 100vw, 1300px" /></p>

<h2>Other Ways of Sharing Google Drive Videos</h2>
<p>If you want to directly share a Google drive video, you can do so in just a few moments. Here’s how to do it.</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Google Drive and log into your account.</li>
<li>Locate the video you want to share and right-click it.</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Share</strong> option.</li>
<li>You can now add a recipient by typing in the contact name or the email address of the person that you want to share your video with and clicking <strong>Send</strong>. You can also share your video via a link by selecting your preferred access controls and clicking the <strong>Copy Link</strong> option to copy the shareable link onto your clipboard.</li>
</ol>
<p>Google Drive is a must-have for anyone who creates and shares video content on a daily. If you&#8217;ve been using Drive for a while now and are looking for something with a bit more to offer, especially for video, you might want to check out Jumpshare.</p>
<p>Jumpshare lets you add custom static or animated thumbnails as well as CTA (call-to-action) buttons to your videos, both of which appear wherever you choose to embed your content.</p>

Nothing beats one-on-one interaction since there seems to be so much lost in the pixelated barrier of the screens separating you. The best online collaboration tools understand that the idea isn’t just to come close to mimicking physical interaction; it is about <em>adding</em> to the experience. It is about designing features that enhance the experience of remote collaboration, and huddle is one of these clever offerings. It offers a more efficient and unobtrusive way to have one-on-one or group audio conversations with your teammates. It’s essentially like the voice channels on <a href="https://jumpshare.com/blog/how-to-use-discord-video-chat/">Discord</a> but has a slightly different interaction.</p>
<h2>How to Start or Leave a Slack Huddle</h2>
<p>Starting and ending a huddle in Slack is pretty straightforward. You can huddle with someone from within their Direct Message thread and then invite additional participants by name. You may also start a huddle with everyone on a particular Slack channel. Other members may also join your ongoing huddle.</p>
<p>1. Open a Direct Message thread or channel.</p>
<p>2. At the bottom of the left sidebar, you’ll find a toggle switch with a headphones icon on it. Flip it to initiate a huddle. Alternatively, you may hit Ctrl+Alt+Shift+H on Windows or Cmd+Shift+H on Mac.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3013 aligncenter" src="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/How-to-Start-a-Slack-Huddle.jpg" alt="How to Start a Slack Huddle" width="1300" height="491" srcset="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/How-to-Start-a-Slack-Huddle.jpg 1300w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/How-to-Start-a-Slack-Huddle-300x113.jpg 300w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/How-to-Start-a-Slack-Huddle-1024x387.jpg 1024w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/How-to-Start-a-Slack-Huddle-768x290.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1300px) 100vw, 1300px" /></p>
<p>3. You are now able to add more people to the huddle by name, share screen, and turn on video using the icons displayed beside the toggle.</p>
<p>4. To leave the huddle, just toggle the switch off, and you’re out.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3012 aligncenter" src="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/How-to-Leave-Slack-Huddle.jpg" alt="How to Leave a Slack Huddle" width="1300" height="513" srcset="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/How-to-Leave-Slack-Huddle.jpg 1300w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/How-to-Leave-Slack-Huddle-300x118.jpg 300w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/How-to-Leave-Slack-Huddle-1024x404.jpg 1024w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/How-to-Leave-Slack-Huddle-768x303.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1300px) 100vw, 1300px" /><span id="more-3001"></span></p>
<h2>How to Join a Huddle or Accept a Huddle Invitation</h2>
<p>Once you’re in a huddle, people will see a small headphones icon next to your name on Slack. If someone wants to have a quick word with you, all they have to do is enter the huddle. If you’re in a channel-wide huddle, a small antenna icon will appear next to the channel name as an indicator.</p>
<h3>Joining an Active Huddle</h3>
<ol>
<li>When a huddle is active on a particular Slack channel, you’ll see a small headphones icon next to the channel’s name, along with profile images of the huddle&#8217;s participants.</li>
<li>Head to the channel and click on the huddle toggle in the bottom-left corner.</li>
</ol>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3015" src="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Channel-Huddle-in-Slack.jpg" alt="Channel Huddle in Slack" width="1301" height="293" srcset="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Channel-Huddle-in-Slack.jpg 1301w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Channel-Huddle-in-Slack-300x68.jpg 300w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Channel-Huddle-in-Slack-1024x231.jpg 1024w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Channel-Huddle-in-Slack-768x173.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1301px) 100vw, 1301px" /></p>
<h3>Accepting a Huddle Invitation</h3>
<p>The only time a huddle gives you a notification is when someone is inviting you to one. Which makes sense, considering they’re trying to get your attention.</p>
<ol>
<li>When someone is inviting you to a huddle, you’ll hear an alert sound, and a small notification will appear in the bottom-left corner of the app.</li>
<li>If you’re available and would like to be a part of the conversation, click on <strong>Join </strong>to start talking.</li>
<li>However, if you’re busy or need some time, you can select <strong>Not Now</strong> and get back to the conversation later.</li>
</ol>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3014 aligncenter" src="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Join-Slack-Huddle-Notification.jpg" alt="Join Slack Huddle Notification" width="1300" height="489" srcset="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Join-Slack-Huddle-Notification.jpg 1300w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Join-Slack-Huddle-Notification-300x113.jpg 300w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Join-Slack-Huddle-Notification-1024x385.jpg 1024w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Join-Slack-Huddle-Notification-768x289.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1300px) 100vw, 1300px" /></p>
<h2>How to Share Your Screen, Turn on Video, and Take Notes in a Huddle</h2>
<p>Once you&#8217;re in a huddle, you may use the icons to the left of the aforementioned headphones toggle to perform the following actions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Add more team members by name</li>
<li>Share your entire screen, a particular browser tab, or a specific window</li>
<li>Turn on video</li>
<li>React to the conversation with emoji</li>
<li>Mute your mic</li>
<li>Turn on live captions, change your video background, and more from the <strong>three dots menu</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3020 aligncenter" src="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Slack-huddle-video-chat.jpg" alt="Slack huddle video chat" width="1142" height="864" srcset="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Slack-huddle-video-chat.jpg 1142w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Slack-huddle-video-chat-300x227.jpg 300w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Slack-huddle-video-chat-1024x775.jpg 1024w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Slack-huddle-video-chat-768x581.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1142px) 100vw, 1142px" /></p>
<p>A maximum of two people can share their screens at the same time in a huddle. Both the presenter and participants can draw over the shared screen.</p>
<p>Click the <strong>threads icon</strong> above the toggle to add notes or share links in a separate thread meant only for the current huddle. The <strong>new window icon</strong> beside it allows you to open the huddle in a separate window &#8211; this might be more suitable for video-enabled huddles.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3019 aligncenter" src="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Huddle-Notes-Message-Thread.jpg" alt="Huddle Notes Message Thread" width="1300" height="904" srcset="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Huddle-Notes-Message-Thread.jpg 1300w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Huddle-Notes-Message-Thread-300x209.jpg 300w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Huddle-Notes-Message-Thread-1024x712.jpg 1024w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Huddle-Notes-Message-Thread-768x534.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1300px) 100vw, 1300px" /></p>
<h2>How Many People Can Join a Slack Huddle?</h2>
<p>Slack&#8217;s free plan allows only two people to be in a huddle at the same time. The premium plans allow for up to 50 participants. Only users within the same workspace can see a huddle in progress.</p>
<p>The feature is available across all platforms on Slack&#8217;s desktop, mobile, and web apps.</p>
<h2>Slack Huddle vs Conventional Video Calls</h2>
<p>The purpose of the Slack huddle is in the name itself. The best way it could be described would be that it’s you taking someone aside to have a quick discussion. The Slack huddle lets you share your screen so that you can have a chat about work in real-time with visual aids, allowing you all to stay on the same page even if you aren’t in the same office space. Unlike Zoom or video conference calls, the huddle isn’t a planned meeting &#8211; its design mimics the pace of an office workday, a lightweight call focusing primarily on audio.</p>
<p>The best part about the Slack huddle is how informal it is, removing all the unnecessary ado of scheduling in-house meetings and just getting to the point immediately. It can help make remote teams more efficient and build rapport through less tedious interactions.</p>
<h2>Recording a Slack Huddle with Jumpshare</h2>
<p>While huddles are meant to be unscheduled and relatively casual, sometimes you may end up discussing something you’d really like to remember. Slack doesn’t offer you the option to record huddles at the time of writing, but you can still record a huddle in progress as a video with Jumpshare.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://jumpshare.com/screen-recorder">Jumpshare screen recorder</a> lets you record your screen along with your webcam, system audio, and click tracking, all in a few clicks.</p>
<ol>
<li>Download Jumpshare for Windows or Mac.</li>
<li>Launch Jumpshare and sign in.</li>
<li>Click on the Record button, or use the shortcut Alt+Shift+2 on Windows and Cmd+Shift+2 on Mac.</li>
<li>Choose whether you want to record your entire screen, a part of it, or just the huddle window.</li>
<li>Hit Finish when you&#8217;re done.</li>
</ol>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3022 aligncenter" src="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Jumpshare_record-screen.jpg" alt="Jumpshare screen recorder" width="1300" height="670" srcset="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Jumpshare_record-screen.jpg 1300w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Jumpshare_record-screen-300x155.jpg 300w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Jumpshare_record-screen-1024x528.jpg 1024w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Jumpshare_record-screen-768x396.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1300px) 100vw, 1300px" /></p>
<p>Your screen recording will automatically be uploaded to your Personal Library and a link to it will be copied to your clipboard for quick and easy sharing. You can also share this screen recording via email, along with a small note for your recipient.</p>
<p>To ensure that your system audio will be recorded, open the drop-down menu to the right of your profile image, select Preferences, and check under the General tab to see if the System Audio option is enabled.</p>

From connecting with your audience to disseminating important information, video is the most effective tool in driving your point home and ensuring maximum retention. Owing to the ease and rising adoption rates, collaborating via video has quickly replaced in-person meetings to become the new norm, with Zoom being the leading contender for the best video conferencing platform.</p>
<h2>Why Would You Change Your Zoom Background?</h2>
<p>User-friendly, accessible, and foolproof, Zoom meetings are a convenient substitute for in-person meetings. While conducting business meetings from your bedroom has its perks, finding a clean and professional background can prove to be a hassle. That is where Zoom’s Virtual Background options come in handy! You can <a href="https://jumpshare.com/blog/how-to-blur-background-in-zoom/">blur your background</a> or swap it out for an image or video of your choice. In just a few clicks, you can set your background to mimic a library, a luxe office, or even your puppy’s cutest picture to score a few brownie points with your audience.</p>
<p>Zoom’s background feature is available for use across all platforms, including the desktop app for Mac and Windows and the mobile apps for both iOS and Android. This useful feature adds an extra layer of privacy to all your Zoom meetings, enabling you to attend meetings from anywhere without compromising on professionalism.<span id="more-2977"></span></p>

<h2>Alternatives to Zoom Virtual Backgrounds</h2>
<p>In a world where Zoom meetings are the new norm, knowing how to change your Zoom background always comes in handy. However, sometimes finding the right virtual background that aligns with your meeting may prove to be an added hassle. Luckily, Zoom allows you to <strong>blur your background</strong> in just a few clicks, allowing you to take meetings from wherever you want without compromising your professionalism. Whether you blur your video or choose a virtual background, the end result is dependent on a vast array of factors ranging from your lighting to your camera quality. In a low-light setting, for example, Zoom might have trouble differentiating you from your surroundings, resulting in a messy outline.</p>
<p>If the sole purpose of your Zoom meeting is to record a video or send updates, you can save time and hassle by using <a href="https://jumpshare.com/record-zoom-meeting">Jumpshare’s screen recorder</a>. Record a specific area of the meeting window, cutting yourself out of the recording completely if needed. As soon as you hit Finish, Jumpshare will automatically upload the recording to your Personal library and copy the link to your clipboard for quick and easy sharing. While Zoom allows you to collaborate in real-time, only meeting hosts can record meetings or grant recording permissions. With Jumpshare, you can easily record any meeting to view at a later time, even as a participant. Whether you want to revise a lecture or keep a record of a meeting, Jumpshare allows you to record, annotate, share, and edit your screen recordings seamlessly.</p>
