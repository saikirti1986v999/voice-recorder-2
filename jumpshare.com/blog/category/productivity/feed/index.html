<p>Carrying on with our renewed focus on video features, we’ve revisited our web-based video editor, rebuilding it from the ground up to be several times more powerful and easier to use.</p>
<h2>Enjoy A More Visual Video Editor</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3360 aligncenter" src="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/New-Video-Editor-Interface.jpg" alt="" width="2203" height="1068" srcset="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/New-Video-Editor-Interface.jpg 2203w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/New-Video-Editor-Interface-350x170.jpg 350w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/New-Video-Editor-Interface-1024x496.jpg 1024w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/New-Video-Editor-Interface-768x372.jpg 768w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/New-Video-Editor-Interface-1536x745.jpg 1536w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/New-Video-Editor-Interface-2048x993.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2203px) 100vw, 2203px" /></p>
<p>The first thing you’ll notice is the all-new interface and user experience. Similar to conventional video editing applications, the new UI shows a preview of your video above a visualization of its audio waveform. This makes it far easier to see exactly what you’re cutting out of your videos.</p>
<h2>Trim From the Sides and Cut From the Middle</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3361 aligncenter" src="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Trim-and-split.gif" alt="Trim and split" width="1000" height="127" /></p>
<p>Remove filler words, silences, and unneeded segments from within a video with ease. In addition to trimming videos from the sides, the new video editor lets you pick any point in a video at which to split it and cut out unnecessary portions.</p>
<p>You can create as many splits as you want. The video editor will automatically stitch everything together when you’re done editing.</p>
<p>Made a mistake? No problem! Simply hit the Undo button to roll back your last action. And if you’re unhappy with all of your edits, click Revert to Original to start all over.</p>
<h2>Be Precise With Keyboard Controls</h2>
<p>The new editor isn’t just easy to use, it can also be very precise when you need it to be.</p>
<p>Click on the scrubber or one of the handles on either side of a video or each of its splits, then use the Left and Right directional keys on your keyboard to nudge them back and forth. Ensure that you don’t cut even slightly more or less than you need to.</p>
<p>To learn more about how to trim your videos with the new editor, read our Help Center guide here: <a href="https://secure.helpscout.net/docs/6001a41dc64fe14d0e1fb4fd/article/61af8a27cec96836600b7724/">How to trim your videos</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>Other Improvements: New Look for Timed Comments &amp; Transcription in Search</strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-3362 aligncenter" src="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Time-comments.jpg" alt="" width="1300" height="645" srcset="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Time-comments.jpg 1300w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Time-comments-350x174.jpg 350w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Time-comments-1024x508.jpg 1024w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Time-comments-768x381.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1300px) 100vw, 1300px" /></p>
<p>We’ve improved how timestamped comments are displayed atop videos, with each comment now showing the commenter’s profile photo above the seek bar. Know at a glance who left a comment at a certain point in your video. Click a photo to instantly jump to the comment both within the video and in the comment section on the right.</p>
<p>In addition, Business and Enterprise users can now search for videos by their <a href="https://jumpshare.com/blog/introducing-automatic-captions-and-transcription-for-videos/">generated transcription</a>. No need to remember file names. Find any video in seconds by searching for the content inside them!</p>
<p>Our new and improved online video editor is available to <a href="https://jumpshare.com/pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jumpshare Plus, Business, and Enterprise</a> users today. Give it a go and let us know what you think. As always, we look forward to your feedback.</p>
<p>Happy editing!</p>

From brainstorming new ideas to collaborating on day-to-day tasks, everyone leans heavily on the power of instant visual communication to be more productive. That is where Slack comes in. Valued at a staggering $20 billion, Slack is a popular workplace chat app that facilitates instant communication.</p>
<h2>What is Slack?</h2>
<p>User-friendly, fast, and convenient, Slack is a workplace chat app that acts as a single hub for messaging, tools, and file sharing. Meant to be used by teams spread across multiple devices, the app offers lots of additional tools and integrations to make team collaboration a more streamlined experience. You can send direct messages, create groups, share files, integrate with third-party apps, and share ideas in multi-person audio and video calls with screen-sharing.</p>
<h2>Where is Slack Available?</h2>
<p>You can use Slack through your web browser or download their app on your desktop (Mac/Windows) or mobile (iOS/Android) device. To make the most of Slack, we recommend using the mobile app in conjunction with the desktop app. That way, you can keep track of chat notifications on your phone whenever you aren&#8217;t at your workstation.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-2793 aligncenter" src="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Slack-UI.jpg" alt="" width="1300" height="833" srcset="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Slack-UI.jpg 1300w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Slack-UI-300x192.jpg 300w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Slack-UI-1024x656.jpg 1024w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Slack-UI-768x492.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1300px) 100vw, 1300px" /><span id="more-2787"></span></p>
<h2>How Much Does Slack Cost?</h2>
<p>Slack’s basic plan is free for all. You can send messages across your team, browse through the most recent 10,000 messages and get 5GB for file storage.</p>
<p>All in all, Slack offers four pricing plans &#8211; Free, Standard ($8 a month per user), Plus ($15 a month per user), and Enterprise Grid, with bespoke pricing plans for corporate clients with diverse needs. The Slack pricing page over at <em>slack.com/pricing</em> offers more insight into their pricing tiers.</p>
<h2>How to Get Started With Slack</h2>
<p>You can sign up for Slack in a few simple steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Visit Slack’s website at <em>slack.com </em>and choose one of the sign-in options to begin the signup process.</li>
<li>Once the signup process is complete, click on <strong>Create a Workspace</strong> and pick a name for your Slack team.</li>
<li>Enter the name of a project you are currently working on.</li>
<li>Add the emails of associates with whom you would like to work on that project.</li>
<li>Your slack team chat will then open in a browser window.</li>
</ol>
<h2>How to Accept an Invitation to Slack</h2>
<p>You can join any workspace you have been invited to by following a few simple steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Check your inbox for an email from Slack.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Join Now</strong>.</li>
<li>Enter your name, choose a password, and then click <strong>Create Account</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Does Slack Offer Integration With Other Apps?</h2>
<p>Yes! You can add dozens of apps to Slack to reel in information from multiple sources, set calendar appointments and reminders, or add other useful features to facilitate team collaboration.</p>
<p>To integrate an app with Slack, all you need to do is visit the <a href="https://slack.com/apps" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Slack App Directory</a> and pick your desired apps. You can also visit the App Directory by clicking your team name to open the Team Menu and then selecting Apps &amp; Custom Integrations. Slack offers integrations with most everyday-use apps including GitHub, Calendar, Zapier, and Trello. There is an option to even integrate Giphy into your Slack, which allows you to summarize your feelings using apt GIFs, keeping the office conversation light and open. However, if you are a free Slack user, you will be limited to adding a maximum of 10 app integrations to your Slack.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-2794 aligncenter" src="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Slack-App-Directory.jpg" alt="Slack App Directory" width="1300" height="785" srcset="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Slack-App-Directory.jpg 1300w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Slack-App-Directory-300x181.jpg 300w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Slack-App-Directory-1024x618.jpg 1024w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Slack-App-Directory-768x464.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1300px) 100vw, 1300px" /></p>
<h2>What Does the Slackbot Do?</h2>
<p>Slackbot is the name given to Slack’s built-in virtual assistant. Slackbot can assist you in a multitude of ways, from keeping notes for you to managing private files. Click on the Slackbot in the Direct Messages menu to get started. You can also use Slackbot to customize responses. When users use your chosen words, Slackbot can be programmed to respond with the phrases or emojis of your choice.</p>
<p>This feature comes in surprisingly handy when it comes to repetitive queries. For instance, if your team has a tendency to forget the WiFi password, you can just program the password as a response and streamline the entire process.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-2796 aligncenter" src="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Slackbot.jpg" alt="Slackbot" width="1300" height="232" srcset="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Slackbot.jpg 1300w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Slackbot-300x54.jpg 300w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Slackbot-1024x183.jpg 1024w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Slackbot-768x137.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1300px) 100vw, 1300px" /></p>
<h2>Why Do People Prefer Slack for Team Chat?</h2>
<p>When Slack came into the picture, it dominated the corporate communication arena. While there were a lot of communication and networking apps around, none of them were geared towards streamlining workspace collaboration.</p>
<p>Slack is known for two things &#8211; its incredibly user-friendly design and its constant evolution to keep pace with evolving consumer needs. With its intuitive UI, Slack revolutionized not only person-to-person messaging but also group messaging. You can create channels for group chat, send direct messages to individual team members, follow chat threads, and do so much more, all within one app. Easy to use, reliable, and great for non-technical users, it is obvious why Slack stands out amongst the crowd of lukewarm communication apps.</p>
<h2>Is Slack a Collaboration Essential?</h2>
<p>From sending messages across your team to uploading and sharing files, Slack seems to do it all. Does that make it a must-have app in every corporate office? While Slack might not be a collaboration <em>essential</em>, it sure makes working together a more enjoyable experience. From sending private messages to collaborating in teams, Slack comes quite close to mimicking collaborating in person. Its only shortcoming is the lack of context and fluency that is inherent to text messages and the hassle of scheduling audio or video meetings. That is where Jumpshare comes in. Jumpshare makes it easier to get your message across visually.</p>
<p>The app allows you to record your screen, annotate your screenshots, and share the results on Slack or practically anywhere else in just a few clicks. With remote and hybrid work quickly becoming the norm, apps like Jumpshare and Slack are important, if not essential, workplace partners.</p>

Seriously. Note-taking is an art. Taking notes, and taking them <em>effectively</em>, allows you to relieve stress, organize yourself, and boost your productivity &#8211; both in your personal and work routines.</p>
<p>Digital note-taking apps have attempted to take this action and recreate it &#8211; and then some. These days note-based apps are <em>more</em> than the sum of their parts, designed to ensure easy and smart note creation and organization. For a digital app to be as easy to use as a pen and paper, it must have a simple interface, but it must also offer more. It should be aesthetic, intuitive, able to sync seamlessly across devices, and able to allow you writing access offline.</p>
<p>With these criteria in mind, we looked at some of the best note-taking apps across the web that come with their niche features, while being relatively cost-effective.</p>
<h2><strong>The Best Note-Taking Apps</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="#microsoft-onenote">Microsoft OneNote</a> &#8211; the best free note-taking app</li>
<li><a href="#evernote">Evernote</a> &#8211; the most feature-rich notes app</li>

<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/onenote/digital-note-taking-app" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Microsoft OneNote</a> is part of the whole Microsoft 365 suite and has made this list because it offers a wide range of features for free. Now, we know the Microsoft OneNote interface leaves much to be desired, but for all the plethora of features it offers &#8211; it is completely free. That’s a huge perk. And while the interface is not user-intuitive, it is inherently simple because of how familiar it is to use. There’s the Microsoft Office ribbon at the top that has a litany of features that are often reserved for premium customers in other apps.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>OneNote can be used on unlimited devices. You aren’t restricted to two devices (like in Evernote’s free plan) or need to pay for access to other devices.</li>
<li>It is completely free. You will never have to pay for any of the features they advertise, including technical features that you may have to pay for on other apps in this list.</li>
<li>It is freeform. You can click and start writing anywhere on the page, like an actual notebook, or start drawing. You can also attach images or videos and audio anywhere on the page.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>OneNote’s interface is pretty barebones and can be unappealing.</li>
<li>The app offers a limited amount of sorting options.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pricing</strong></p>
<p>OneNote is completely free but OneDrive, where all your notes &#8211; including images, audio, and videos &#8211; are stored offers 5 GB of free space. After that, it’s $1.99/month for 100 GB.</p>
<h2 id="evernote">The Most Feature-Rich Note-Taking App</h2>
<p><strong>Evernote </strong>(Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, and web)</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-2858 aligncenter" src="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Evernote.jpg" alt="Evernote" width="790" height="509" srcset="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Evernote.jpg 790w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Evernote-300x193.jpg 300w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Evernote-768x495.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 790px) 100vw, 790px" /></p>
<p><a href="https://evernote.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Evernote</a> has been around since 2000, and it’s incredibly popular. Even if you’ve never used it, we’re pretty sure you’ve heard of it or seen its green elephant logo somewhere. It’s a cross-platform digital notebook that offers some niche features to users, has an aesthetic interface, and can view and edit almost any file format that you can throw at it &#8211; everything but Markdown.</p>
<p>It is <em>the</em> digital notebook, there’s no denying it. It has an intuitive interface and myriad features that work across different platforms. It’s expensive, yes, but it offers an instinctive and multi-tiered note-taking experience, curated to fit both your personal and professional needs. And it makes your notes look good!</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Evernote offers a Web Clipper browser extension, which allows you to clip out parts of articles online and save them in your digital notes to go through later.</li>
<li>The app has a nifty mobile feature that allows you to scan and save something as a text document. Not kidding &#8211; you can take a picture of something with text and it will scan and save the text. You can search for the words in the picture and Evernote will present it to you.</li>
<li>Evernote offers a large range of third-party integrations &#8211; such as with <a href="https://jumpshare.com/how-to/add-send-gifs-in-slack/">Slack</a>, Zapier, or Google Calendar, allowing you to curate your workday, take care of appointments, or map out projects in the same place.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The free plan only offers you two devices on which the app can be used.</li>
<li>The app works like a couple of digital notebooks, allowing you to ‘tag’ notes, or put sticky notes onto pages/notes to bookmark them. It can get a little cluttered.</li>
<li>Evernote’s paid plans are expensive &#8211; it may be a good option for professional use, but can be a bit steep otherwise.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pricing</strong></p>
<p>Evernote offers a free plan and two paid plans. The Personal plan is for $7.99/month and the Professional plan is for $9.99/month.</p>
<h2 id="notion">The Best Note-Taking App for Collaboration</h2>
<p><strong>Notion </strong>(Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, and web)</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-2859 aligncenter" src="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Notion-app.png" alt="Notion app" width="790" height="494" srcset="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Notion-app.png 790w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Notion-app-300x188.png 300w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Notion-app-768x480.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 790px) 100vw, 790px" /></p>
<p>Database-driven and with a clear, legible interface, and nested hierarchal options, <a href="https://www.notion.so/product" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Notion</a> is a powerful note-taking option for both personal and professional use. Notion shines as a collaboration platform when it comes to note-taking. It allows teams to communicate quickly over notes via comments and in-app notifications and updates. You can review pages and restore previous versions. And while it’s great for collaboration, it allows you complete control over what you share: it’s divided into a Workspace section and a Private section.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Notion is very flexible, allowing you to create sub-pages within pages on a versatile template. You can also embed high-quality videos and images into the pages.</li>
<li>The app lets you create powerful databases via tables. Every row in the table can be opened as a page and edited further.</li>
<li>Multi-functional formatting allows you to add Markdown, code, and equations. You can use your keyboard shortcuts to format text. Notion offers you varied text formatting options, including highlight and strikethrough.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Notion does not offer offline support.</li>
<li>The app works with blocks, which can be vexing to edit and format.</li>
<li>Pages can be difficult to sort and sift through, making it easy for the interface to get cluttered.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pricing</strong></p>
<p>Notion’s free plan &#8211; Personal &#8211; offers you unlimited blocks but is limited to 5 collaborators. It has three paid plans: when billed annually, Personal Pro is $4/month while Teams is $8/month. Their Enterprise plan is customizable.</p>
<h2 id="google-keep">The Best Note-Taking App for Google Users</h2>
<p><strong>Google Keep </strong>(iOS, Android, web, and Google Chrome)</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-2860 aligncenter" src="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Google-Keep.jpg" alt="Google Keep" width="790" height="399" srcset="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Google-Keep.jpg 790w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Google-Keep-300x152.jpg 300w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Google-Keep-768x388.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 790px) 100vw, 790px" /></p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/keep/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Google Keep</a> is a part of the Google Docs cross-platform collective suite that offers you a variety of professional tools. It works like your Google-based office. If you’re deep into the Google ecosystem, or just use Google features a lot on the go, Google Keep is the note-taking app for you. It may be an okay notes app, but it gets its edge with how well it integrates with other Google platforms. Other than YouTube, the little lightbulb option for Keep appears on all Google services if you decided to sign up for it. You can click on this icon and go through your notes at any time, across any Google service.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Google Keep can be synced across all your devices and platforms that offer you a Google log-in.</li>
<li>It is incredibly simple to use and has a very familiar interface that resonates with most users.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>While it works with iOS, it is best suited to Android users.</li>
<li>The app doesn’t offer varied organizational options. Honestly, there’s just one level of tags, which may not be enough at times.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pricing</strong></p>
<p>It comes with 15GB of free storage across all Google features. After that, it starts at $1.99/month for 100GB of storage.</p>
<h2 id="apple-notes">The Best Note-Taking App for iPhone, iPad, and Mac</h2>
<p><strong>Apple Notes</strong> (macOS, iOS, and web)</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-2861 aligncenter" src="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Apple-Notes-app-iPad-iPhone.png" alt="Apple Notes app for iPad and iPhone" width="790" height="503" srcset="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Apple-Notes-app-iPad-iPhone.png 790w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Apple-Notes-app-iPad-iPhone-300x191.png 300w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Apple-Notes-app-iPad-iPhone-768x489.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 790px) 100vw, 790px" /></p>
<p>Apple Notes, previously known as iCloud Notes, is a powerful digital note-taking option for Mac, iPhone, and iPad users. As an Apple user, you don’t need to look any further than Apple Notes as your app of choice. The app is incredibly simple, both in aesthetic and function, does its job well, and is targeted at both the common user as well as power-users.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Apple Notes is free and is part of the iOS and macOS default apps.</li>
<li>It offers nested hierarchal options, which is a rare feature to find in a completely free service.</li>
<li>It is intuitive and easy to use, and there’s no cross-platform switching like in Google Keep since you just need to log in to your iCloud to access your notes across platforms. You can even open it on your Apple Watch.</li>
<li>It offers a gallery/checklist view for note formats.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The service is best suited to those who are already Apple users.</li>
<li>It does not offer Markdown formatting options.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pricing</strong></p>
<p>You get free 5GB storage across all iCloud platforms. Extra storage starts at 50GB for $0.99/month.</p>
<h2 id="obsidian">The Best Note-Taking App for Brainstorming, Markdown</h2>
<p><strong>Obsidian </strong>(Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, Linux)</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-2862 aligncenter" src="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Obsidian-notes.png" alt="Obsidian notes" width="790" height="419" srcset="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Obsidian-notes.png 790w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Obsidian-notes-300x159.png 300w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Obsidian-notes-768x407.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 790px) 100vw, 790px" /></p>
<p><a href="https://obsidian.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Obsidian</a> is an avant-garde knowledge base disguised as a note-taking app that entirely uses Markdown to create notes. It cheekily vows to take over your entire life as a working database for it. It’s a tall order, but hear us out &#8211; Obsidian does it well. If you’re ready to put in the work to get to know the app well, it will help you organize yourself better. The app works on backlinks, outgoing links, and graphs &#8211; allowing you to connect everything in your head like a mind map.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The app works completely offline. All the notes you create through Obsidian are stored in a local folder on your system.</li>
<li>It has an aesthetic and visually appealing interface.</li>
<li>If you understand Markdown, Obsidian can help you create notes very quickly with functional hierarchy. It’s like short-hand.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It’s not as easy to use for people who’ve never needed to use or been exposed to Markdown.</li>
<li>The app can get overwhelming for new users and has a steeper learning curve.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pricing</strong></p>
<p>Obsidian’s free plan offers users all of its core features. More detailed and premium features can be found in their two paid plans: the Catalyst plan, which has a one-time cost of $25, and the Commercial plan, which costs $50/user/year.</p>
<h2 id="roam-research">The Best Web-Based Markdown Notes App</h2>
<p><strong>Roam Research </strong>(Web)</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-2863 aligncenter" src="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Roam-Research-notes.jpg" alt="Roam Research notes" width="790" height="550" srcset="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Roam-Research-notes.jpg 790w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Roam-Research-notes-300x209.jpg 300w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Roam-Research-notes-768x535.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 790px) 100vw, 790px" /></p>
<p><a href="https://roamresearch.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Roam Research</a> works in almost the same vein as Obsidian &#8211; it is a note-taking app that works on Markdown and as a database that’s interconnected like a web where a single note can lead to many more, via links. These links are created by you as you write your notes using markdown and can be used to create a large knowledge base. Like Obsidian, it’s modeled on the way a mind would work. On the other hand, it has a much clearer interface than Obsidian does and is web-based.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The app is intuitive and offers users a delightful note-taking experience, allowing you to start creating notes immediately as the app opens without any unnecessary ado.</li>
<li>Seamless linking between connected pages, allowing you to cycle between them with complete ease.</li>
<li>Roam Research offers users a Graphical overview as visual representations of which and how many pages connect.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The app does not work if you aren’t online, ironically.</li>
<li>Users that are well-versed with Markdown may be far more comfortable with this app than complete novices.</li>
<li>It may take a long time for new users to understand how to use the app, and even longer to use it to their advantage.</li>
<li>It’s a very expensive service and doesn’t offer any free plans.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pricing</strong></p>
<p>Roam Research offers two paid plans. The Pro plan costs $13.75/month when billed annually, and the Believer plan costs $500/five years.</p>
<p>Visual communication and succinct note-taking (hello, minutes) are the bread and butter of remote collaboration. As an all-in-one visual communication platform, Jumpshare prides itself on catering to all of these core necessities in a single service. Jumpshare too offers users a fundamental notepad in which you can hurriedly scribble a reminder for yourself or a to-do list. The Compose Note feature also allows users to create content in code and Markdown, which can be shared quickly via link or email with collaborators.</p>

<p>Ever since the untimely demise of the Google URL Shortener, we’ve all been trying to find something that might pick up the mantle of the best link shortener out there. Goo.gl was super convenient &#8211; quick and, more importantly, free to use. Since it was decommissioned in 2018, many other services have come to light that do <em>more</em> with URLs &#8211; allowing you to track click data, share links faster on social media platforms, manage links, and customize link domains.</p>
<p>With that in mind, we’ve compiled a list of a few of the best free link shorteners in no particular order and highlighted why you might want to give them a shot.</p>
<h2>The Best Free Link Shorteners</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="#rebrandly-branded-links">Rebrandly</a> for branded links</li>
<li><a href="#bitly-unlimited-clicks">Bitly</a> for unlimited click tracking</li>

<li><a href="#short.io-mobile-targeting">Short.io</a> for mobile targeting</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="rebrandly-branded-links">Best URL Shortener for Branded Links</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.rebrandly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><strong>Rebrandly</strong></a></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-2920 aligncenter" src="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Rebrandly-for-branded-short-links.png" alt="Rebrandly for branded short links" width="790" height="333" srcset="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Rebrandly-for-branded-short-links.png 790w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Rebrandly-for-branded-short-links-300x126.png 300w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Rebrandly-for-branded-short-links-768x324.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 790px) 100vw, 790px" /></p>
<p>For an app with advanced features even in its free plan, Rebrandly has an incredibly easy-to-use (and easy on the eyes) interface. With its desktop apps and browser extensions, Rebrandly is more than a URL shortener &#8211; it is a link management platform that allows you to shorten, customize, brand, track, and integrate your links securely and with ease.</p>
<p><strong>Features</strong></p>
<p>Signing up with a free account offers users:</p>
<ul>
<li>unlimited link redirects, with 5000 clicks tracked/month</li>
<li>up to 5 custom domains for personalized link branding</li>
<li>URL slugs customization and slash tags in five different ways (shortest, random, suggested, SEO-friendly, and suggested camel case)</li>
<li>more than 50 app integrations (including Zapier and Slack), with link sharing to major social media platforms</li>
<li>editable URL destinations and extensive link history, with QR codes</li>
<li>advanced link tracking (with stats including location, time, browser, and the number of clicks).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Highlight</strong></p>
<p>If you’re a small business looking to work on your custom branding and branded links, Rebrandly is the app for you. The platform packs a punch even with its free plan and is highly scalable and user-friendly.</p>
<h2 id="bitly-unlimited-clicks">Best URL Shortener for Unlimited Click Tracking</h2>
<p><a href="https://bitly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><strong>Bitly</strong></a></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-2921 aligncenter" src="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Bitly_URL-shortener.png" alt="Bitly URL shortener" width="790" height="417" srcset="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Bitly_URL-shortener.png 790w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Bitly_URL-shortener-300x158.png 300w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Bitly_URL-shortener-768x405.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 790px) 100vw, 790px" /></p>
<p>Bitly is one of the most popular URL shorteners out there. It offers users a chrome extension for faster access and features a simple web dashboard that offers all its tools with visual clarity. While Bitly has advanced link features, they are reserved for their paid plans. These include bulk-shortening, link permissions, email support, campaigns, and QR codes, among others. However, its free plan allows users a decent amount of link-tracking.</p>
<p><strong>Features</strong></p>
<p>Signing up with a free account lets users:</p>
<ul>
<li>shorten and track up to 100 secure links per month</li>
<li>track an unlimited number of clicks for each link</li>
<li>view referrers and click locations</li>
<li>customize link back-halves (slugs, basically).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Highlight</strong></p>
<p>The highlight of using Bitly &#8211; and the reason for its popularity &#8211; is how accessible it is. If you’re in a bind and want to shorten a link quickly, you just need to head to their homepage and paste it in the long box there. You’ll get a secure link within a second and you can copy it with the click of a button. It’s pretty neat.</p>
<h2 id="tinyurl-link-customization">Best URL Shortener for Quick Link Customization</h2>
<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><strong>TinyURL</strong></a></p>

<p>Odds are that even if you’ve never used it, you’ve probably come across a link created through TinyURL. TinyURL is the most straightforward URL shortener of this bunch and most of its advanced features, like custom branding and link monitoring, are part of its paid plans. Even the web dashboard of its free account is pretty barebones and extremely simple to use.</p>
<p><strong>Features</strong></p>
<p>With its free plan, users get:</p>
<ul>
<li>unlimited shortened URLs and link history</li>
<li>URL slug customization and unlimited active links</li>
<li>a choice between alternative TinyURL domains, or a vanity TinyURL domain.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Highlight</strong></p>
<p>TinyURL is where you go when you want to make a quick, anonymous link that you want to share immediately. This is probably why it’s so popular &#8211; like Bitly, it offers a free URL shortener on its homepage. Unlike Bitly, however, it lets you customize your slug and choose between TinyURL’s other domains before creating a link, and without needing to sign up.</p>

<p><a href="https://short.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><strong>Short.io</strong></a></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-2923 aligncenter" src="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Short.io-URL-shortener.png" alt="Short.io URL shortener" width="790" height="378" srcset="https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Short.io-URL-shortener.png 790w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Short.io-URL-shortener-300x144.png 300w, https://blog-cdn.jumpshare.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Short.io-URL-shortener-768x367.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 790px) 100vw, 790px" /></p>
<p>If we’re talking about interfaces, Short.io is a great place to start. Its design is beginner-friendly and very organized, which keeps the user from feeling a little lost in the features that the software offers. The best part about the app is that it offers a number of advanced features, albeit limited, for free, that most other apps offer in their paid plans. Of note among these is a feature that allows you to redirect visitors based on their mobile operating system.</p>
<p><strong>Features</strong></p>
<p>When you sign up for a Short.io free account, you get:</p>
<ul>
<li>5 custom domains with 1000 branded links, and link automation (bulk-shortening, e.g.) for 1000 links</li>
<li>mobile targeting to redirect to a specific destination based on a user&#8217;s mobile operating system</li>
<li>unlimited redirects and the ability to track 50,000 clicks</li>
<li>responsive mobile and desktop apps for quicker access, and browser extensions</li>
<li>app integrations with Zapier, Segment, and Slack</li>
<li>destination URL and URL slug editing, with an SSL certificate by Let’s Encrypt.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Highlight</strong></p>
<p>Okay, we know it’s not free, but Short.io offers a particularly cool feature that most apps don&#8217;t: geographical tracking and traffic routing. Based on the visitor’s location, you can direct them to different pages of your website. It’s pretty neat, especially if you’re a big company with a site that gets international visitors.</p>
<h2>Other Notable Link Shorteners</h2>
<p>There are many other noteworthy free or reasonably-priced URL shorteners on the web that do more than just the bare minimum and have distinct features to offer. <a href="http://Tiny.cc" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Tiny.cc</a>, for one, lets users add a logo to their links. <a href="http://Sniply.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sniply.io</a>, for another, allows users to add a CTA feature to their links to direct traffic.</p>
<p><a href="https://dash.shor.by" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Shorby</a> is designed specifically for links catering to Instagram. <a href="https://adf.ly" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">AdFly</a>, which is another popular open-source software, allows users to monetize their clicks, even if it doesn’t offer the best visual interface or user experience.</p>
<h2>Link Shortener for Your File Sharing Needs</h2>
<p>With the convenience that having a short link affords you, both in function and aesthetic, services now offer URL shortening as part of their integrations.</p>
<p>As a multi-tiered visual communication platform, <a href="https://Jumpshare.com">Jumpshare</a> focuses heavily on quick file sharing via link and email. It&#8217;s designed to reduce the time taken between link generation and file sharing, which is why it has a built-in URL shortening feature that is automatically applied to all links generated, based on your custom domain and branding. It even offers per-file analytics so you can track how your shared files are being viewed.</p>
