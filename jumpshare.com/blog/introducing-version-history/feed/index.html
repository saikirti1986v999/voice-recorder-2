					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jumpshare.com/blog/introducing-version-history/#comment-4779&quot;&gt;Lukas Rohal&lt;/a&gt;.

Hello Lukas, we&#039;re delighted to hear that. We&#039;re definitely planning on making our window bigger on desktop apps with large thumbs and more space for file names. The search bar implementation is currently underway. We&#039;ve finished the design and will implement it soon in out upcoming updates.

Thank you for your feedback! Please keep them coming, and don&#039;t forget to spread the word! Have a great day! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I like your service and how you are progressing! I&#039;m a happy Plus user. I wish there is a little more visual polishing of desktop apps (I mean a bit bigger app window, so there is more room for file name etc.; especially on Mac, where the Copy link and Share button gets into the file name text...) and search in desktop apps. That would be amazing!]]></description>
